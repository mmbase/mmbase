HOWTO Maven 2 (Apache Maven 2.0.6 and up)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Clean, build and install the mmbase.jar in the local repository:

   mvn clean install

   [compare with: ant clean; ant jar]

- Build and install all mmbase 'applications' in the local repository

   (cd applications; mvn clean install)

   [compare with: (cd application; ant clean; ant jars]

-  Build a simple war from the justly created artifacts.

   (cd example-webapp; mvn clean install)

   [compare with: ant bindist]

   This is 'the' distro. A simple and clean war. It's pom can serve as an example to create your
   own webapp.


- How to build everything
  (cd maven ; mvn clean install)


But normally you can just type 'mvn' in the directory of interest. It will use artifacts of
mmbase.org/snapshots if you didn't build them.



- If you have access to mmbase.org, you can also do

  (cd maven ;  mvn -Pdeploy clean deploy)

  which will clean and deploy pretty much everything for a release, including source-jars.

  (use a ~/.m2/settings.xml containing this:
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>mmbase</id>
       <username>mmweb</username>
     </server>
   </servers>
