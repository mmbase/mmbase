HOWTO maven (for people who used to use the 'ant' build)

Use maven 1.1 (_not_ 1.0, _not_ 2)

- ant jar -> maven jar, maven jar:install
maven -Dmaven.test.skip=true jar:install

- ant     -> maven

- ant bindist -> maven all:install, cd example-webapp; maven war:install


If e.g. mmbase.org is unreachable, add 'maven.offline=true' to maven-base/build.properties.
Sadly it is impossible to find out how to configure a timeout setting for that.

The equivalent for 'ant clean' is 'maven all:clean' to clean all applications, and 'maven clean' to only clean the present one.



HOWTO MAVEN2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to compile everything:

1. Build and install the mmbase.jar in the local repository:

mvn clean ; mvn

compare with: ant clean; ant jar

2. Build and install all mmbase 'applications' in the local repository

(cd applications; mvn clean ; mvn)

compare with: (cd application; ant clean; ant jars_

3. Build a simple war form the justly created artifacts.

(cd example-webapp; mvn clean ; mvn)

coompare with: ant bindist



But normally you can just type 'mvn' in the directory of interest. It will use artifacts of
mmbase.org/maven2 if you didn't build them.



- If you have access to mmbase.org, you can also do
  mvn deploy
  (use a ~/.m2/settings.xml containing this:
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>mmbase</id>
       <username>mmweb</username>
     </server>
   </servers>
