  <body>
    <p>
      URL composers contain the information to create an URL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most classes in the package extend from URLComposer which
      provides default functionality itself for this task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one exception is URLComposerFactory, which implmentates the
      decision which URLComposer to instantiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other one is 'Config' which takes care of installation
      configuration (e.g. about where some templates are installed).
