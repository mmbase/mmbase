    <title>Media filters</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      URL-filters for the MMBase media project. To determin the 'best'
      URL, first a list of all URL's is created and then this list is
      filtered by 'MediaSourceFilter'
    </p>
    <p>
     Some filters are 'Comparator', wich means that they are
     implemated as a java.util.Comparator (so can only sort).
    </p>
    <p>
      I propose to rename this package to org.mmbase.media.filters.
