  <!-- 
  This file is an EXAMPLE only!
  
   This file is used by the 'class-authentication' utility to configure the classes with are authenticated.
   Class-authentication can be called by specific security implementation to check the login method 'class'.
   
   The format of this file is therefore the same as that of the 'wrapper', only the 'authentication'
   entry can/should be left away, and the 'method' attributes can also be left away becasue they should
   be 'class'.

   If a wrapper is used, this file is not used.
 -->
  <!-- authenticate 
       class: regular expression matching the classes which can be authenticated.
       method: the login 'application', should be 'class' in this file.
       property: name/value pair which will be added to the credential-map.
       -->
