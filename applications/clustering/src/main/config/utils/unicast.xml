        name="unicastport" on what port does this multicast talking between nodes
        take place, This can be set to any port but check if something else on
        your network is allready using multicast when you have problems.
    -->
    <property name="unicastport">16080</property>

    <!--
        If you want to use the same config file for differnt servers on the same host, then you can
        also set the port by prefixing it with the machine name.  This syntax can also be used, if
        different ports for different servers must be used, because these settings are used for both
        receiving and sending.
        E.g. like this:
    -->
    <property name="michiel.omroep.nl/mm18/.unicastport">16080</property>
    <property name="michiel.omroep.nl/mm182/.unicastport">16081</property>

    <!--
        name="unicasttimeout"  the time another MMbase server has to respond.
    -->
    <property name="unicasttimeout">10000</property>


    <!--
        Two protocols for encrypting the byte arrays are supported.
        Version 1 is the original way and will make a connection for every message
        When using version 2, all queued messages will be send in one connection.
        They are not compatible, so your complete cluster must be configured with the same version.
        Or, you could prefix the property names to make sure the correct version is used for the correct server.
    -->
    <property name="version">1</property>


    <!--
        Normally it is determined using the mmservers table with which
        other machines contact must be made. In some occasions, you
        don't want that. E.g. if the clustering set up is made use of
        the unicast/multicast converter tool
        (org.mmbase.clustering.Converter).
        Then, you may explicitely configure all peers, which then takes precedence.
