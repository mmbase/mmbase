			MMBase itself is released as OpenSource product (see main website). But to allow us to create this MMRunner version we needed to include a application server and a database. Since we wanted a simple and 100% java solution we used orion and hypersonic but MMBase itself supports many more both commercial and opensource products.<BR><BR>
			About Orion :<BR><BR>
			Orion is a great j2ee application server that is 100% java based, easy to install and follows all the new and hip specs. Its not free but at $1500 its very cheap indeed and it is free for development and non-profit use. Many thanks to the orion people for allowing us to include it in the demo version. More info on orion at www.orionserver.com.

			About Hypersonic :<BR><BR>
			Hypersonic is a small 100% java based JDBC database, its opensource, fast very small (about 100kb). It also supports a memory only mode what we use in the demo meaning that its empty once you stop the server. For more info on Hypersonic at http://hsql.oron.ch.<BR><BR>
