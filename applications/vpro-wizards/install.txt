install notes for the vpro-wizards
--------------------------------
The vpro-wizards is part of the mmbase applications, and can be build and installed with  maven. Mind you don't need to build the vpro-wizards if you just want to use them. ready build packages are available for download.
Make sure you read the 'Considerations' section carefully.



Maven installation
--------------------------------
You need maven2.

To compile the vpro-wizards with maven, you don't need to checkout mmbase at all. All the components you need are prebuild and ready to download.
You just have to add some stuff to the maven build of your webapp that will use the vpro-wizards.

Next you create a dependency to the vpro-wizards in your application.

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mmbase</groupId>
  <artifactId>mmbase-vpro-wizards</artifactId>
  <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <type>war</type>
</dependency>


You also need to change your web.xml.
See e.g.:
https://scm.mmbase.org/mmbase/trunk/applications/vpro-wizards/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.fragment.xml

Manual installation
--------------------------------
It is also possible to manually install the vpro-wizards. You can download a war file containing the
maven build module from http://www.mmbase.org/maven2/org/mmbase/mmbase-vpro-wizards

1) unpack this over your webapp.
2) change also your web.xml


Dependencies
--------------------------------
The vpro-wizards have a number of dependencies. Here is an overview:
VPRO-Wizards
  +- Spring
     +- commons-logging
     +- commons-lang
  +- Spring webmvc
  +- Nekohtml
     +- xerces
  +- collections-generic

If you want to use the CachHandlerInterceptor and the org.mmbase.applications.vprowizards.spring.cache.CacheWrapper You will also need need the oscache jar.

Spring-mock is used to run the (integration) tests, you don't need it for run- or compile time.

Nekohtml is an html parser/filter that is used to clean richtext input.
Collections-generic is a version of commons-collections that supports generics.
You can examine the maven project.xml file to see what versions are used to build the VPRO-Wizards, and you can run "maven war:war" to create an archive that contains little more than these jars.


Considerations
---------------------------------
Some things that are important to know when  using the vpro-wizards
- The vpro-wizards use Spring mvc for handling actions. The means that a servlet declaration needs to be added to the webapp's web.xml. There is a web.xml.fragment file, that both ant and maven installations place in your webapps' WEB-INF folder. But you do need to merge the two manually, or the vpro-wizards won't work.
- The example editor is base on mynews, so make sure mynews is installed if you want to play around with those.

Enjoy!
