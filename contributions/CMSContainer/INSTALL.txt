Follow the following steps:

Step 0:

Install the following versions of the software:
- Java 1.5
- Maven 1.0.2  (use a maven 1 version. Maven 2 is not supported yet.
- Tomcat 5.5
- Mysql 4.1


Step 1:
Set the following environment settings:
(use your install paths)
# java settings
  JAVA_HOME=c:\java\1.5
  JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx256M -Dfile.encoding=utf-8
# Remote debgging
  JPDA_ADDRESS=8000
  JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket
# maven settings
  MAVEN_HOME=C:\java\maven-1.0
  MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL=c:\projects\.maven
  Path=%PATH%;C:\java\maven-1.0\bin
# tomcat settings
  TOMCAT_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5
  CATALINA_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5

Step 2:
Make maven work:

2a
Create a file build.properties in your HOME dir which maven will use for its default settings
on windows: %HOMEPATH%\build.properties
on linux: $HOME/build.properties

Add the below line to the file 

maven.repo.remote=http://www.mmbase.org/maven/,http://mmapps.sourceforge.net/distributions,http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven,http://maven-plugins.sourceforge.net/maven,http://www.codeczar.com/maven

note that it is http://mirrors.ibiblio.org which replaces the maven default http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/
At the moment, downloads with maven1 fail on http://www.ibiblio.org/maven/ with a response code 301

2b
Upgrade your maven ear plugin from version 1.6 to 1.6.1 with the following 
command:
maven plugin:download -DgroupId=maven -DartifactId=maven-ear-plugin -Dversion=1.6.1

The cmsc maven build will only succeed when the artifacts of the mmbase head are
present in the local maven repository, There is not yet a remote repository 
with up-to-date artifacts available on mmbase.org. The remote repository on finalist
intranet site are up-to-date enough to build this project.

The mmbase head artifacts can be installed by checking out the ALL module from 
cvs.mmbase,org. After the checkout run "maven all:install" in the root.
More information is in the MMBASE.txt and MAVEN.txt files
 

Step 3:
Configure tomcat and the database:
- The cmsc uses a J2ee datasource for the database connection of mmbase.
  The <TOMCAT_HOME>/common/lib should contain the following jars.
  * commons-collections-3.1.jar
  * commons-dbcp-1.2.1.jar
  * commons-pool-1.2.jar
  * mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar

- The server/tomcat directory contains a xml file which should be moved to
  <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/Catalina/localhost.
  Alter the settings in this file to match your local database

- Create an empty database
 
Step 4:
- Run the first-time-cmsc.bat (or .sh) in scripts directory.
  NOTE: following runs should use cmsc.bat to clean previous build files.
- And start your tomcat.

  Front-end: http://localhost:8080/cmsc-webapp/TestSite/


Tips:
- set the environment setting "BUILD_OPTS" to "-o" to increase the build time a lot
  using this setting, maven will not try to download stuff from remote repositories,
  so make sure everything is already local!
