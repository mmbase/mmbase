Email component

    the email component is based on the mmbase-email module:
    http://www.mmbase.org/mmdocs/modules/email.html

    src/email/templates/email contains most of the code for
    the frontend.

    configuration:

    web.xml:
        emailsenderdomain
            the context-parameter that determines the email domain
            prepended to the username that is used as the sender-adress.

        see also src/email/webinf/web-extra.xml


     config/modules/sendmail.xml
     config/modules/smtp.xml
        these are taken from the mmbase email module.
        note that smtpmodule.xml needs to know the current hostname
        smtp port and list of domains for which to accept email.

        the config.properties files
