The basic idea of the assessment component is that a student goes through an education and at the end of each learnblock makes an
assessment on her current situation. A student can specify goals and problems. After each learnblock the problems are rated and questions
related to the problem answered. The assessment matrix gives an overview of the results per learnblock.

Some assessment specific relations:

- A relation between an education and the assessment component object determines whether the assessment is active for this education.
- Student can classify their problems in 3 problemtypes, for each problemtype their should be:
  a. translation in the language bundles
  b. a test in each of the education using assessements
- The tests for the problemtypes are not shown for the first learnblock in the education. The emphasize in the first learnblock should
  be on specifying goals and problems.
- The assessment matrix does not contain the columns for the last two learnblocks. The last learnblock is assumed to contain conclusions. 
  The one before last learnblock shows a evaluation test, which is the test related to the education, that is not related to a problem type.
- When a page in the education has a relation (rolerel) to the assessment component the button go to assessment is shown on this page.
- Pages can have links to other pages, these cross-references are created by using descriptionrels. When using the link only this page
is opened in the targeted education. When clicking on the education name the entire education is opened in the navigation.
