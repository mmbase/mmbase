The basic idea of the assessment component is that a student goes through an education and at the end of each learnblock makes an
assessment on her current situation. A student can specify goals and problems. After each learnblock the problems are rated and questions
related to the problem answered. The assessment matrix gives an overview of the results per learnblock.

Some assessment specific relations:

- A relation between an education and the assessment component object determines whether the assessment is active for this education.
- When a page in the education has a relation (rolerel) to the assessment component the button go to assessment shown on this page.
- Pages can have links to other pages, these cross-references are created by using descriptionrels. When using the link only this page
is opened in the targeted education. When clicking on the education name the entire education is opened in the navigation.
