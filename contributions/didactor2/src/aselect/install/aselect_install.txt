INSTALLATION OF ASELECT FOR DIDACTOR

Author: H. Hangyi
Date: 28-02-2006

INTRODUCTION

This installation guide is only a small introduction on how to install ASelect. 
See for the full technical en installation documentation http://a-select.surfnet.nl/

The ASelect solution consists of three parts (together with Didactor it is four):

A. authspserver: takes care of the authentication with the external authentication directory (ldap, active directory)
B. aselectserver: takes care of the sessions of already authenticated users
C. aselect agent: facilitates communication between Didactor and the aselectserver
D. didactor

INSTALLATION
To install the ASelect package download A-Select Version 1.4.2 from http://a-select.surfnet.nl/ and install it.

For Linux use: aselect_1.4.2_installer.bin
For Windows use: aselect_1.4.2.exe

NOTE: A number of configuration files have to be set. The directory config_examples contains two example sets,
to show how it should look like:

-didactor.proteon.nl (linux)
-mmatch.xs4all.nl (windows)

The examples let the user ldap-user authenticate by using the ROCZeeland test LDAP.
To test if you can connect to this LDAP do the following:
1. Download and install Softerra LDAP Browser 2.5 (http://www.softerra.com/download/download.php)
2. Create a new profile. 
2.a. Set host to: 80.127.88.230. You don't have to use a Base DN
2.b. Set User DN to: ldap-user,o=rocz
2.c. Set Password to: l#d@ph*3
3. Click on finish

A. AUTHPSERVER

The authpserver has two parts:

A.1. /A-Select/1.4.2/bin/webapp/authpserver

This should be added as a webapp to a Tomcat installation

A.1.a. In aselectserver/WEB-INF/web.xml the working_dir parameter should be set correctly:

<init-param>
   <param-name>working_dir</param-name>
   <param-value>/A-Select/1.4.2/work</param-value>
</init-param>

A.1.b. The ldap servlet should be enabled:

<servlet>
   <servlet-name>LDAPAuthSP</servlet-name>
   <servlet-class>org.aselect.authspserver.authsp.ldap.LDAPAuthSP</servlet-class>
   <init-param>
      <param-name>config_id</param-name>
      <param-value>ldap</param-value>
   </init-param>
   <load-on-startup>5</load-on-startup>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
   <servlet-name>LDAPAuthSP</servlet-name>
   <url-pattern>/ldap</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

A.2. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/authpserver

Configuration used by the authpserver. The following file should be set correctly.

A.2.a. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/authspserver/conf/authsp.xml

CHECK:

1. make sure the AuthSPServer can connect to your LDAP back-end i.e. try telnet 80.127.88.230 389 from console
2. the logs are in \A-Select\1.4.2\log\authspserver (or somewhere else depending on the settings in authsp.xml)
3. you can see the SAM service run on: http://localhost/authspserver/sam
4. you can see the LDAP service run on: http://localhost/authspserver/ldap

B. ASELECTSERVER

The aselectserver has two parts:

B.1. /A-Select/1.4.2/bin/webapp/aselectserver

This should be added as a webapp to a Tomcat installation

B.1.a. In aselectserver/WEB-INF/web.xml the working_dir parameter should be set correctly:

<init-param>
   <param-name>working_dir</param-name>
   <param-value>/A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectserver/sam/.</param-value>
</init-param>

B.2. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectserver

Configuration used by the aselectserver. The following files should be set correctly.

B.2.a. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectserver/conf/aselect.xml
B.2.b. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectserver/conf/flatfile/flatfile.udb
B.2.c. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectserver/conf/keystores

Generate a key for the aselectserver with keytool and store it in this folder.
See the ASelect documentation on how to create a key:

http://a-select.surfnet.nl/version/1.4.2/guide/aselectsrv.html#deploy

To use authentication without flatfile.udb, you should change the A-Select Server
config file (aselect.xml) in order to use another (probably LDAP) UserDB (UDB).
See the deployment guide on the A-Select Server for the UDB:

http://www.a-select.org/version/1.4.2/guides.html#deployment

Out of the box there's 3 different UDB's:
    * FlatFile User Database
    * LDAP User Database
    * JDBC User Database
    (* SASDB User Database -> specific!)

I you want to use LDAP, please refer to:

http://www.a-select.org/version/1.4.2/guide/udb/jndi.html#deploy

This describes how to deploy a JDNI compatible backend such as LDAP. It
also shows a configuration example. Make sure that the LDAP has/support
the A-Select schema to provide the A-Select Server with the right
attributes for a user (think of the config as it is in de flatfile, but
now registerd in the LDAP).

CHECK
1. the logs are in \A-Select\1.4.2\log\aselectserver (or somewhere else depending on the settings in aselect.xml)
2. you can see the aselectserver run on: http://localhost/aselectserver/server
3. you can see the SAM service run on: http://localhost/aselectserver/sam

C. ASELECT AGENT
The agent runs as a service on the webserver and facilitates Didactor to connect to the aselectserver.
Under Windows the agent service is installed automatically by aselect_1.4.2.exe. Under Linux use:

i. Download the A-Select 1.4.2 installer
ii. Run installer -> Integration Components -> Agent
iii. Start run script /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectagent/local.aselectagent start|stop

If no start script has been created (this may occure when you installed another version of aselect on this server before):
  
i. Install agent as above
ii. Move /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectagent/agent.xml to /A-Select/1.4.2/bin/aselectagent
   (the script won't find the file in the work/aselectagent folder)
iii. Add a start script(agent_start.sh) to /A-Select/1.4.2/bin/aselectagent
iv. agent_start.sh has only one line: "nohup java -jar org.aselect.agent.jar &"

Configuration of the Agent is done by the settings in:

C.1. /A-Select/1.4.2/work/aselectagent/conf/agent.xml (ports, logging and aselectserver)

CHECK:
1. To test the agent use:
http://localhost:1495/?request=authenticate&app_url=http://mmatch.xs4all.nl/didactor/login_aselect.jsp&app_id=mmbase&a-select-server=xxxx;
xxxx= id of aselect server (here it is aselectserver1)
Make sure the application and server ids are set correctly.

D. DIDACTOR

ASelect authentication is switched on (or off) by placing (or removing) didactor-aselect.jar from didactor\WEB-INF\lib

Didactor uses the following file for configuration of ASelect:

didactor/WEB-INF/config/security/agent.conf
