This folder is intentionally left empty (except for this readme.txt).

The builders that have to be copied to this directory depend on the application you want to deploy.

For all applications: copy the builders from config/applications/NatMM/builders to this folder

For using the natmm templates: 
- set auto-deploy of NatMM.xml to true or load the NatMM application from the MMBase admin pages

For using the nmintra templates: 
- copy the builders from config/applications/NMIntra/builders to this folder
- set auto-deploy of NMIntra.xml to true or load the NMIntra application from the MMBase admin pages
