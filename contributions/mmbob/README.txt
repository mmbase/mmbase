This is a forum system somewhat like phpbb but based on mmbase, it can be integrated with a mmbase site. Its a 'create' a new forum (with subareas) by a click of a button. So it allows you to run one mmbob system for multiple sites or one for a whole site. Each forum can have its own settings and look and can for the large part(s) be set using a gui interface.

- needs MMBase.1.8.0 and the contributions multilanguagegui and thememanager.

- to install mmbob follow the following steps

  1) copy the mmbase-1.8.0.xxxxxxx-mmbob.zip file you downloaded to the ROOT of your
     webapp (for example tomcat/webapps/ROOT/).

  2) unzip the file in this dir.

  3) ./mmbase-1.8.0.xxxxxxx-mmbob/scripts/install_bin.sh


- Once installed you can open the mmbob forum system by visiting mmbob/index.jsp, and read the operational help files from there.
