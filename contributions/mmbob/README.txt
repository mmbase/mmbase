This is a forum system somewhat like phpbb but based on mmbase, it can be integrated with a mmbase site. You can create a new forum with subareas by a click of a button. So it allows you to run one mmbob system for multiple sites or one for a whole site. Each forum can have its own settings and look and can for the large part(s) be set using a gui interface.

- You need a servlet 2.4 application server like Tomcat 5. 
- You need MMBase 1.8
- You need contribution multilanguagegui
- You need contribution thememanager
