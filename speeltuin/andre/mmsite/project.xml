  <description>
    A MMBase application for things like site structure, nice links etc.
    It basically uses two nodetypes: pages and templates. Pages contains 
    a field path that can get resolved by SiteUrlConverter to the original page.
    A template is a pulldown in the editor for a page, build from the nodelist 
    of all templates nodes.
    
    Besides that this application contains a functionset 'mmsite' to create a 
    crumbpath of pages. Other nodetypes are also possible as long as they contain
    a field named 'path' with a legal path. It works quite simple like this:
    
    /                 homepage, the page with path value '/'
    /section          page node called 'Section' with path value '/section'
    /section/news     page called 'News' where field path has as value '/section/news'
    /section/news/ab  page with path value '/section/news/as'
      
    When the function 'crumbs' is used in the page 'ab' it returns a nodelist 
    with all the pages nodes untill the homepage, being: homepage, section and 
    news (in that order).
