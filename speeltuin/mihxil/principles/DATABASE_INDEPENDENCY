Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Database independency
Qualification:
Explanation:
      All code is implemented in a database independent way.
Argumentation:
     MMBase is principally indepent of the chosen database. So all code in MMBase should not depent
     on features of a specific database (unless of course the code _is_ the specific database layer).
    
     Therefore this is also a principable for applications built on MMBase, otherwise they are not
     portable to other MMBase installations.

Consequence:
      You should use the search-query frame-work to build queries, without falling back to 'legacy'
      constraints.

      If should not need JDBC-connections yourself, but if you do, use ((DatabaseStorageManager)
      MMBase.getStorageManager()).getConnection()
      You should also issue an issue to the mmbase bugtracker to report the issue you are working
      around here...
