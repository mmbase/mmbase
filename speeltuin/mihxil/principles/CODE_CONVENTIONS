Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Code conventions
Qualification:
Explanation:
      All source code is subject to code conventions.
Argumentation:
      Code conventions makes it easier and more comfortable to read and understand each others code.

Consequence:
      When writing Java, JSP or XML sources, you must take the MMBase Code conventions into account.
     
      Summary for java:
      Java code is indented by 4 spaces. SUN's code conventions. See link.

      XML:
      XML code is indented by 2 spaces.       

      JSP:
      
      Preferably, JSP is like XML (e.g. JSPX). Java code in JSP should be limited to an absolute
      minimum. Use taglib (MMBase taglib, JSTL). Complicated functionality could be done in some
      MVC-framework, or be delegated to functions implemented on MMBase datatypes, fields, builders
      or functions sets.
      A JSP should be short.  A few hunderd lines is much.
      Use includes, but prefere dynamic includes (mm:include, jsp:include) over static includes
      (jsp:directive.include)

       Switch off the session <jsp:directive.page session="false", unless good reason to use the
       session exists.

       Make pages cacheable by a front-proxy, (e.g. by using mm:content), unless a good reason
       exists not to (then explicitely make it uncacheable, e.g. by using mm:content expires="0")

       Always use UTF-8 for the response.
     
       Preferred is (valid) XHTML Strict.      


       Javascript:
         Like java.

      CSS:
         K&R, indent with 2 spaces.
	
Allowed Implementations:
       Code wich obeys the conventions.
