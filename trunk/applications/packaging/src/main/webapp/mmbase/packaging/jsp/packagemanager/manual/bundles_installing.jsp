	By pressing <b>bundles</b> <b>[1]</b> in the navigation bar you will goto the bundle ovverview page. Here you can see all the bundles your MMBase installation can access at the moment (see providers for more info). In this case we want to install the 'MyNews example' so we select it by either pressing the name itself [3] or the arrow at the end of the same row [2].

	The bundle overview page is divided into 3 areas. The first area [1] 'bundle information' provides information about the selected bundle. It provides basic information like the name, type and version of the bundle. It also shows the time it was created by who and where this bundle is hosted. The Second area [2] called 'Bundle actions' shows us all the actions we can do on this bundle. The last area [3] is meta information included in the bundle it ranges from who worked on it,a longer description, what license is attached, who to contact for information. Since we want to install this bundle we select 'install' from the action area [4].

	The package manager will now start installing the bundle, it will download/transfer the bundle to its local import storage, and perform a install on all the included packages. During this it will provide feedback in the form of progressbar's and log information. If all want as planned and no errors occurred (warnings are allowed) you should get a screen similar to this one and the install is complete. We do advice you to do restart of the application server/mmbase at this point.

	In this example i already installed all the needed builders to make sure i got several warnings in step 5. You can 'zoom' into each install step with problems using the [2] buttons in step 5 and 6. with each 'zoom' the error/warning becomes more clear and detailed.
