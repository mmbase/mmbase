			<title>Security framework within MMBase</title>
			<para>Within MMBase is a security framework, in which different security implementations can be used. In this way it is possible to adapt MMBase to the needs of the environment in which it runs. Currently there are a few different implementations ready. The context security and the cloud security are the most advanced schemes available.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="context_security">
			<title>A security implementation with contexts</title>
			<para>The NOS ( a Dutch broadcasting company) choose an implementation with contexts. A context exists of a set of rights which describe what you can do within this context with an object of MMBase. For example you define read access to a the context which is used by anonymous visitors of your site and you can define a context with edit rights for registered users of your site. The main parts of the security framework are:</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Single users (users)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Groups (users)</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>Contexts</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</section>
		<section id="users">
			<title>Users</title>
			<para>The users of MMBase can have different levels anonymous or registered users. The anonymous users are the normal page viewers. There rights are being served through the anonymous module of MMBase. Registered users are being served through the user/password module, this are the users that can alter data within MMBase.</para>
			<para>For registered users there is also an extra level called rank. The default ranks are &#39;Basic user&#39; and &#39;Administrator&#39;. These ranks can denote extra rights within MMBase. The anonymous users can only have the rank &#39;Anonymous&#39;.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="groups">
			<title>Groups</title>
			<para>A Group can exist of users and/ or groups. In this way you can define a structure which inherits rights from lower levels. For example the office-sweeper group may read the newspaper. The office-clerk group is member of the office-sweeper group but may also use the toilet. So a member of the office-clerk may read the newspaper and go to the toilet, even at the same time. While a office-sweeper can only read the paper and work fast to get home in time to use the bathroom. As you probably noticed a stupid example which might help to understand the framework.</para>
			<para>A user van be member of more than one group within MMBase.</para>
		</section>
		<section id="contexts">
			<title>Contexts</title>
			<para>Each object within MMBase has a context. Which context is associated with an object can be seen in the owner field of that object. The name found there is the name first used as context before fallback on the default context. In the context is defined which rights are granted to a user or group. The following rights are available.</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>read, read the content of an object.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>write, write content to an object.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>link, making a relation between two objects.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>delete, remove an object.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>create, create a new object of the type typedef. The so called editors.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>change, changing of context.</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<para>Of each context is also know to which context it may change. An admin may change to a user but a user may not change to an admin.</para>

		<title>How to configure the security-framework</title>
		<tip>

			<title>General</title>
			<para>The security framework makes it possible to use different implementations for security within MMBase. The implementation that will be used depends on the configuration file which can be found in your configuration directory and then in the sub-dir called security. The file security.xml is the file you are looking for. The file security.xml should look like this (All comment lines have been left out)</para>

			<para>Within this document you can alter the following items:</para>

					<para>/security[@active] : Valid values are &#39;true&#39; and &#39;false&#39;. If the value is set to true then the selected security shall be loaded.

[to do: what means the last part of the sentence]</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>/security/authentication[@class] : This denotes which implementation will be loaded as security. Setting this parameter to org.mmbase.security.NoAuthentication will disable authentication.</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>/security/authentication[@url] : In this element you can give parameter for the security implementation like a configuration file for that security type.</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>/security/authorization[@class] : The implementation that will check if the requested operation is valid for this user in MMBase. Setting this parameter to org.mmbase.security.NoAuthorization will disable authorization.</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>/security/authorization[@url] : Same as with authentication, you can give additional parameters here. Like the location of a configuration file.</para>

				<listitem>
					<para>/security/sharedsecret : It is possible to run more than one MMBase on the same data source if that is true then they will use this password to communicate.</para>

				<title>Reference field [to do: what does this mean?]</title>
				<para>Within MMBase has each object a field called &#39;owner&#39;. The value of this field is used by the security system to select the rights of a user on this object. If the name of this context [todo: it is not clear where this contect refers to] does not exist a warning will be issued in the logs and the default context will be selected.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Contexts</title>
				<para>A context defines which rights a group has on a object. Also is defined within this context to which contexts you can change to assume there rights.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Groups</title>
				<para>A group is a collection of users and groups. In this way you can represent your organisation in the security system. If used properly in combination with contexts for each group.</para>
			</section>
			<section>
				<title>Users</title>
				<para>Anonymous users: These users get there rights from the module called anonymous. They are considered the normal page viewers. There rank will always be &#39;ANONYMOUS&#39;.</para>
				<para>Logged in users: These users are validated through the user/password module of the context security. They are the users which can change your data in MMBase. The rank of these users is normally &#39;Basic users&#39; but can also be &#39;Administrator&#39; which is a rank that grants more rights within MMBase.</para>
