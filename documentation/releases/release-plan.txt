                     MMBase 1.8.0 - Release Plan
===================================================================

TODO for 1.8.0 release of MMBase:

I Core/Project abstraction

The following applications should be removed from the core and moved to a separate application:

- SCAN, including the org.mmbase.module.gui.html.* classes and supporting util classes (i.e. scanpage)
  This includes removing SCAN specific hooks from some core classes (an alternative is needed to provide backward compatibility).
- Email application: find a solution for the email module class interface that is now in the core
- Config module and org.mmbase.config: xml parsers and color coders (perhaps a rewrite is better?)
- Tools: move utility classes, modules, and builders that are still useful to a tools application (or in case this is too hard, tag them for inclusion in a later release)
- Future non-core projects should also be deployed in separate applications packages.
- If possible applicatuons should be configured to work with the Packaging project (if this project proves stable).

II - Cleaning

The following steps should be made to clean the code. Note that part of this is also done during abstraction

- removing all old database support en storage classes
- remove all utility classes, modules, and builders that are no longer used, i.e. DateSupport or Storable
- Mark xerces/xalan dependent code for future change (there is no solution for this dependency yet)
- cleaning of the html-dir

III Improvements

The following Core functionality will be evalued and (if needed and possible) improved in 1.8.  It is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for this one.

- Multicast: select an appropriate (or pluggable) communication system, solve issues with bursts of change events
- Modules and Builders: implement a proper way for loading, unloading, reloading, and shutting down modules and builders
- Security: field-level security checks

IV Performance and Maintenance

Performance issues should be analyzed and if possible resolved. It is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for this one.
Performance and maintenance related issues are:

- Monitoring of MMBase performance issues, i.e. profiling
- Running on packaged war (xml configuration as resources)
- serving images staticly
- related-nodes optimalisation (passing queries to parent)
- create a better build-process

V Projects

The following projects should be finished or brought in a stable state.
This is dependent on input from the project manager.
New projects that are not in a stable state will not be deployed in the 1.8 release.

- Cleaning Project, fase II (see above)
- Distro project
- Field types project
- Richtext project
- Taglib II project
- Packaging project (new, formerly 'Applications II')

VI Other

- update and improve documentation
