                     MMBase 1.6.0 - Readme
===================================================================  
  
MMBase is an Open Source content management system that can be used
for publishing websites (among other things like email, sms,
etc). MMBase  coveres the whole spectrum needed to manage and maintain
information. In other words, MMBase has editors for editorial people
to insert, manipulate, and delete information. 
MMBase uses jsp/taglib as a language which enables web designers to
publish the information dynamically. And MMBase has knowledge of
connected devices. This means that publishing a CD, or an image
(placed on a scanner), or a live stream involves minimal work.

It includes the following contents:

MMBase is distributed in two different 'flavours', mmbase-src and
mmbase. First is the source distribution and the second is the binary
distribution. 

The binary distribution's target users are end-users and first-time
users. It contains a working hsqldb database, applications that can be
deployed and a few working examples.
The logging for the binary distro is going to the standardout, you
have to find out which log file of your Servlet-engine is logging
standard out, for Tomcat 4 ie catalina.out. 

The source distribution's target users are developers who like to start
building their own MMBase.
