===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

release of MMBase 1.9.0, relative to the previous release of MMBase (1.8.x).

============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------
[1.9.0]

- On a lot of places java 1.5 features were used in the implementation of core and applications.
  (like generics, varargs, StringBuilder).

- start on org.mmbase.framework

- command server for image magick (to avoid memory doubling)


Taglib New Features:
-------------------

- varStatus attribute on list-tags (like c:forEach)
- jspvar of writers can have any value.

Editwizard New Features:
------------------------

--------------------
Obsolete Features:
--------------------
[1.9.0]

------------------
Bug Fixes:
------------------
[1.9.0]

---------------------------------------------------------
Known API incompatibilities of bridge, between 1.8 to 1.9.
---------------------------------------------------------

- Bridge. A RelationList is no NodeList any more (though a Relation is still a Node).

- Taglib. <mm:url generates object of type org.mmbase.bridge.jsp.taglib.pageflow.Url (rather then
  String).

- org.mmbase.storage.search.implementation.*. StringBuilders are used in API.


========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

Some pages require servlet api 2.4 (using EL, Jspx).

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.


=========
Tested on:
=========

The applications listed here are known to be tested with MMBase, but
the list is probably a lot bigger :-)

Java versions
-------------

- J2SE 1.5

-------------
Java compilers
-------------

- Sun's javac 1.5
  
  When altering line 115 in org.mmbase.cache.CacheManager from 
    Cache cache = getCache(cacheName);
  to
    Cache<?,?> cache = getCache(cacheName);
  the compiler will run into a bug in Sun's javac regarding the casting of 
  generic types. See: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4916620
