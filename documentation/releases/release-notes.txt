===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the changes that have been made in the final
release of MMBase 1.8.0, relative to the previous release of MMBase (1.7.x).

============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------
[1.8.0]
- Vwms (virtual web masters) have been removed from the core and placed in a
  separate 'vwms' application.

- SCAN is now a separate application. The application depends on the vwms
  application.

- Crontab is a new application that provides scheduling.

- Packaging application.

- Class security provides authentication wrapping based on calling class
  -> classauthentication.xml

- It's easier to make security independent code because of new features about default authentication
  methods.

- Richtext application provides support for kupu-editor, and we basicly have 'rich text' now,
  including inline urls, attachments, images, cross-links and 'blocks' (notes, intermezzo's)

- Images
   Several improvements
   - Support for height and width (predicted before conversion, determined after conversion, and
     stored if corresponding fields are available) (This was ported to 1.7.4 too)
	 'modes' of mm:image.
   - Transformations are postponed to when actually served --> with new image-servlet is possible to
     set up separate image server.

   - FileName of upload can be stored, and be added to the URL (/mmbase/attachments/1234/myfile.pdf)

- ResourceLoader was created, MMBase can more easily be deployed as war now. Most configuration can also
  be shipped inside jars, and be overriden. This means the most applications can principally be installed by
  placing one jar in WEB-INF/lib plus placing jsp's if any.
  --> Some resources are 'mergeable' now

- DataTypes and Field improvements.
   New datatypes 'datetime' and 'boolean'. Support for 'restrictions' on all types, default values,
   uniqueness etc. All on field level.

   DataType 'list' is not yet tested/working.

   This gave rise to complete new package org.mmbase.datatypes which is also part of 'bridge'
   because its classes are accessible through several methods in bridge.

   --> 'typehandlers' of taglib are based on datatypes now.
   --> DateParser
   --> updated builder xml format (using XSD)

- Functions. The function framework was completed. Among others you can now add functions in the
  builder xml (without the need to override the builder class).

- Events. Because of the 'cache release strategy' project, event object were created (in
  org.mmbase.core.events). Work is being done release-strategies. You can also implement different
  cache-backings --> e.g. oscache-impl of Johannes.

- Several new methods on bridge. -> see api-doc

- Tests. The junit test-cases will all succeed when we release 1.8.

- Contributions:   aselect /  mmbar/  mmbob/  multilanguagegui/   thememanager/

- External libraries:  concurrency support (anticipating jdk 1.5)
                       we ship jstl/standard

- Support for oracle / mssql. views.

- Definition of 'bridge': The classes in mmbase-rmmci.jar.

- Clustering is pluggable: clustering application: jgroups, unicast, multicast.

- Cleaning: The cleaning project has made some progress, and quite a lot dissappeared. Most
  noticably the multitude of database layers. There's just one now. Pierre? Nico?

- maven build. Nico?

- better blob-caching.

- cp1252 work arounds. (also in 1.7.x)




Taglib New Features:
-------------------
- Bunch of new tags/attributes (see documentation). E.g. more complete set of has- tags
 (hasnodemanager, hasfunction etc..)

- FileItem. HttpPost useage was dropped. common fileupload's 'FileItem' can be gotten as a jspvar.

- Compatibility with EL. MMBase Taglib variables are now EL variables.
  This may give minor compatibility issues. If this gives too many issues for you, you can switch
  this behaviour off (this needs some testing still though).

- 'escapers' can be more easily added, and they can also be configured on the page (mm:escaper)
  This uses the concept of TransformerFactories and so on. A bit similar to functions.

- EditTag


Editwizard New Features:
------------------------

- Several small improvements

- The editwizard are about to receive a refactoring, which is anticipated for 1.8.1

--------------------
Obsolete Features:
--------------------
[1.8.0]
- The 'ObjectTypes' class is merged into the 'TypeDef' class. Old code
  referencing ObjectTypes should reference TypeDef instead. This includes the
  typedef.xml builder configuration file.

- The storage configuration files were originally located in the mmbase.jar.
  In 1.8, these files have been moved to the storage/database directory in the mmbase config directory. Files that override the storage configuration need to be moved to the new directory.

- The 'Config' module and the 'AppTool' utility have been dropped from the
  code. Both tools provided visual input regarding configuration or
  application makeup, but were considered outdated.
  References to these modules have been removed from the MMBase admin pages.

- Old database layers have been dropped.


------------------
Bug Fixes:
------------------
[1.8.0]
many

---------------------------------------------------------
Known API incompatibilities of bridge, between 1.7 to 1.8.
---------------------------------------------------------
Of course we try to mimimize this, but sometimes it happens...

- org.mmbase.bridge.Cloud#getUser().getRank() does not return a String any more, but an actual Rank
  object --> cloud.getUser().getRank().equals(Rank.ANONYMOUS.toString()); still compiles but doesn't work any
  more!!
  So, if grep your code for that. And see that the change is, though incompatible, a real
  improvement... Quickest fixes are to change getUser().getRank() by getUser().getRank().toString(),
  or remove the 'toString()' on the compared Rank-constant.


- Node#setValue("owner", ..) does no longer throw an exception.

- Empty fields of a node in a Transaction behave excactly like empty fields of a node which is not in
  a Transaction. In previous versions there could be a difference, more specificly with 'not null'
  fields (which for example could still be null in a node which is only commited in the transaction,
  and not yet to the database).

- Processors have been moved to org.mmbase.datatypes.processors (from
  org.mmbase.bridge.util.fields).
  If you used those in 1.7, then you need to recompile, and reconfigure in datatypes.xml.


- Implement 'node' functions on bridge, not core. This ensure awareness, and that functions can be
  called through MMCI. It seems a bit odd to use node interfaces in an otherwise core context, but
  functions are exposed through the bridge, and exposing core object to the outside is even odder.
  


========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================


- If your app-server supports JSP2.0 (e.g. tomcat5 with a 'new'
  web.xml or resin 3), then the new EL (Expression Language) syntax
  collides with the Expression language of mmbase taglib.

  MMBase Taglib JSP's using the ${} syntax might work then, because this is also EL. To locally
  disable, avoid {} (letting it away, or replacing them by []) or add <%@page
  isELIgnored="true" %> to the page.

- Orion version < 2.x doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3,
  because of this the jumpersFilter will not work. You will need to
  remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  (I'm not sure where the last line has to be: web.xml or orion-web.xml).


- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-compliant, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Not all HTML is html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes it is needed to copy xml-apis.jar to
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/> or $ORION_HOME, eg if you're doing
  xslt-transformation or if you're using the editwizards.

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml (perhaps using $DATADIR)

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.
