============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------
[1.7.0]
- Storing blobs (e.g. images) on disk has changed. 
  Blobs are now stored as follows:
  The number of the object containing the blob is broken up in
  parts. The 3 least significant digits are ignored.
  The remaining digits are divided by powers of hundred (pairs of
  digits of 2). 
  These are then broken up in nested directories.
  For instance, the field 'handle' of node with number 5447637 is
  stored as: 
    data/databasename/basename_buildername/54/47/5447637.handle
  while the same field of node number 1205 is stopped as:
    data/databasename/basename_buildername/01/1205.handle

  where 'databasename', 'basename' and 'buildername' are depending on
  configuration and type of the node. 

  This improves performance on systems when you get a large number of
  binary fields. 

  Note: if you are upgrading from 1.7.0 RC1 you need to convert,
  because this 'breaking up' into directories did not yet exist then.

  Note: if you are upgrading from 1.6 or early 1.7 builds and used to
  store blobs on disk using the 'old' storage implementation or the
  'support' implementation (from < 1.6), then too you need to convert
  if you want to use the 'new' storage now (which you want). Note that
  the 'databasename' and 'basename' parts are new in the path (these
  make it easier to toggle between configurations). 

  Make sure the old 'blobdatadir' dir is now WEB-INF/data (use e.g. a
  symlink) 

  You can convert the blobs via the admin pages /mmbase/admin
  admin->BLOBS (which can also be used to migrate from
  blobs-in-database to blobs-on-disk). 

- Query-object, which allows for several new taglib and MMCI
  features. 

- New storage layer, which allows for real transactions! 

- Some 'applications' (like editwizards) have been split up to
  separate jars. This will allow for easier partial upgrades of
  installations. 

- Added functionality to the jsp editors: better paging mechanism. 

- Added functionality to the jsp admin pages: add/change field
  descriptions 

--------------------------
MMCI (bridge) New Features:
-------------------------
[1.7.0]
- All interfaces of the new org.mmbase.storage.search package are part
  of the 'bridge' now.  There is also a new 'Query' object in
  org.mmbase.bridge, which allows for query creation and modification
  in a generic way. 

- The new Query frame work allows for easy execution of 'aggregating
  queries' (e.g. counts) through the bridge.

- The bridge implementation now also lets security modify its queries
  to exclude read-protected nodes. Depending on the security
  implementation and configuration this should speed up things. 

- Several small additions (like Cloud.getRelationManager(NodeManager,
  NodeManager, String)); 

-------------------
Taglib New Features:
-------------------
[1.7.1]
- #6441 container attribute missing on function-tags.
- #6510 mm:relatednodes missing path attribute (also fixed for mm:listnodes)

[1.7.0]
- Content-Tag, which provides default escaping behaviour,
  postprocessing functionality, and content-type information. 

- Container tags.

  - Function Container tag. Allows for more complicated arguments to
    functions on e.g. Nodes. 
  - List Container Tags. Allow for easier generic queries (using new
    Query frame work). The Query object can be changed with a
    'constraint' tag, an 'ageconstraint' tag, a maxnumber tag and an
    'offset' tag. The query can be executed by the already existing
    nodelist tags. Also the size tag, can optionally be used outside a
    list tag now (but inside a list container tag), and will then be
    calculated by the database (and not progamaticly). 

- 'previousbatches' and 'nextbatches' tags. A way to easily make a
  paging mechanism for big search results.

- unrelatednodes tag. A tag to list all nodes (of a certain type)
  which are _not_ related to a node. 

- compare tag: valueSet attribute

- List-tags now provide a kind of 'temporary' context for taglib
  variables. In practice this means that inner context tags (or
  'remove' tags) will not be needed any more. 


-------------------------
Editwizards New Features:
-------------------------
[1.7.1]
- You can now use radiobuttons if you use the ftype 'radio' (like an
  enum), and checkboxes (for values 1/0) if you use the ftype
  "checkbox". 

[1.7.0]
- Multilevel queries can be used to fill optionlists


==========================
BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
==========================

-------------------
Generic Improvement:
-------------------
[1.7.0]
- Several tags in builder xmls are no longer mandatory, and sensible
  defaults will be used instead  (for example in the editor section)
- jspsmartupload has been replaced with jakarta's commons FileUpload
  component. 

------------------

[1.7.0]
- jaxp compliance. MMBase does not longer depend on an old version of
  xerces/xalan/xml-apis when running under java 1.4 you can remove
  those files 

- The HandleServlet now removes additional information left in jpeg
  files by PhotoShop 7. This extra information crashes the image Thread
  of Internet Exploder. While this was not a bug, this fix is very 
  convenient.

- Caching of Query results is done better. It is possible to cache
  everything. In 1.6 some queries accidentally where not cached. This
  fix is based on the new Query framework. 

- When exporting builder xmls, the state property of a field is now in
  lowercase (as defined by the dtd).

- More robust in case Database not up yet if MMBase starts, or if
  database restart when MMBase remains up.

------------------
Security Bug Fixes:
------------------
[1.7.1]
- #6559 Security CCS:SecurityUser cache not started
[1.7.0]
- It is for a security implementation possible to define new ranks
  now. 
- Queries are checked by all 'official' security implementations. If
  there are read-restrictions on defined on your installation, you
  need to create an index on the owner fields.

========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================

- If your app-server supports JSP2.0 (e.g. tomcat5 with a 'new'
  web.xml or resin 3), then the new EL (Expression Language) syntax
  collides with the Expression language of mmbase taglib. 

  MMBase Taglib JSP's using the ${} syntax might not work then. Often
  the {} can be avoided, otherwise the only option is to add <%@page
  isELIgnored="true" %> to the page. 

  The generic JSP-editors in /mmbase/edit/basic could not be fixed to
  work with and without EL. When you want to use these editors in a EL
  environment isELIgnored must manually be added to
  /mmbase/edit/basic/page_base_functionality.jsp (Unfortunately it
  cannot always be present, because this setting can cause errors in a
  JSP1 environment). 

  The EL and MMBase Taglib expressions languages are actually very
  similar to each other. We will try to make MMBase Taglib compatible
  (perhaps optionally so) with EL in a next release. 

- The old database support classes are still in this release, but are
  not fully tested. These are deprecated please DO NOT use them
  anymore, but switch to the new database storage classes.

- Orion version < 2.x doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3,
  because of this the jumpersFilter will not work. You will need to
  remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  (I'm not sure where the last line has to be: web.xml or orion-web.xml).


- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-compliant, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Not all HTML is html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes it is needed to copy xml-apis.jar to
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/> or $ORION_HOME, eg if you're doing
  xslt-transformation or if you're using the editwizards. 

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml.

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.
