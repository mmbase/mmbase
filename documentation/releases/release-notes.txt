INTRODUCTION:

============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------

- Introduction of `MMBaseServlet' with specialisations like ImageServlet and
  AttachmentServlet.
  There's no need for servdb anymore. Note that ImageServlet does not accept a
  'transformation'-template like the 'servdb' servlet of previous MMBase
  versions did. This functionality can be accessed by the imagetag or the 'cache'
  function of an image node.
- Editwizards. A way to define `task oriented' editors in XML.
- Improved support for Oracle
- Added the 'storage' classes. The storage classes are a new (yet experimental)
  interface for adding database support. Supported databases are mysql
  and postgresql. 
  The database configuration classes for these implentations are
  relational.xml and postgresql.xml. 
  These database layers automatically add indexes, and provide
  database support for deep builder inheritance.
- A lot of new documentation has been added to this release. This
  documentation has been created using the docbook-format.
- Character encoding is configurable
- Scan has been turned off by default
- Centralized caches configuration (caches.xml)
- Automatic builder installation for applications
- auto detection of some databases (TODO: add more info)
- Use of webapplication server resources (JNDI)
- DTD's are available in the jar (and removed from the config dir)
- Richtext 0.5
- Security 1.0
- Builder extension (not completely finished)


---------------------
MMCI New Features:
---------------------

- Updated to MMCI 1.2.
- NodeManagers now extends Node, and can be retrieved by number
- cloud.hasNode() and hasRelation() methods
- New FieldValue interface
- Users can now create their own MMCI lists (such as NodeList)
- better exception handling (NotFoundException and AlreadyExistsException)
- more filters to retrieve relations or related nodes

-------------------
Taglib New Features:
-------------------

- mm:formatter, mm:xslt : implement 'Richtext' features  (experimental)
- mm:attachment : for obtaining download links to mmbase attachment objects
- mm:time : for formatting mmbase time and date values
- mm:locale : for setting country locale and language
- mm:cloud tag: new loginpage attribute

---------------------
Examples New Features:
---------------------

- Alternative jsp-editors (aka my_editors) added as an example.


==========================
BUG FIXES AND IMPROVEMENTS:
==========================

------------------
General Bug Fixes:
------------------

- Fixed a problem with memory allocation in the bridge, which could cause
  MMBase to claim disproportional parts of memory when using the Multilevel
  cache. (bug #4282)
- solved a possible deadlock situation regarding the use of database
  connections (bug #3974).
- Calling cloud.getList() with seachdir='source' now works. (bug #3000)
- Multilevel cacheing issues solved (bug #2971)
- When removing a builder from MMBase,referring nodes in
  typerel/reldef are also removed.
- MMBase works inside webapp contexts
- Performance issue resolved regarding MMObjectNode::getRelated() and
  MMObjectNode::getRelated(type) where type is a builder 
- Connection pool can run on a lower amount of connections
- Nodes are always returned with the correct type of builder


------------------
Security Bug Fixes:
------------------

- Fixed a problem with checking whether relations can be added (bug #3602)
- You can no longer delete relations you have no right to delete (bug
  #1932)
- Security can be set in no-read-check mode
- Performance workaround for context/cloud security (possible to grant
  read privilege to everyone)

----------------
Taglib Bug Fixes:
----------------

- Taglib works with Tomcat 4.1.x (version 4.1.12 is the first version
  it's working) 


========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================

- Builder inheritance has been added in MMInformix42Node, this is an
  experimental feature.
- When using Tomcat 4.1.12 mmbase-logs are written into cataline.out
  and localhost_log. This has been fixed in Tomcat 4.1.17.
- Some versions of Orion doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3, because of this the
  jumpersFilter will not work. This is true for Orion 1.5.2 and older
  versions. You will need to remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

  You also need to add:
    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  to orion-web.xml

- MMBase doesn't compile when using J2SE 1.4, you have to change 2
  files by hand: MultiConnection.java and MultiStatement.java (both in
  the <org/mmbase/modules/database>-dir). Uncomment the methods for
  J2SE 1.4, more information is provided in the javadocs in these files.

  When using 1.4 the ant build will inform you about this.

- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-complient, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Html isn't html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes it is needed to copy xml-apis.jar to
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/> or $ORION_HOME, eg if you're doing xslt-transformation
  or if you're using the editwizards.

- When using Tomcat 4.1.x you have to replace xercesImpl.jar from
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/endorsed/> with xerces.jar from
  <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/lib>, otherwise you'll get
  java.lang.VerifyErrors or MMbase won't start at all.

- Sometimes a servlet-engine won't stop when running MMBase, if you're
  using the shutdown script provided by the servlet-engine. This is
  caused by the fact that the jvm won't quit if there are non-daemon
  threads running. The only way to stop the servlet-engine is to kill
  it.    

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in
  <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/config/builders/images.xml> into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerfull when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers don't jump to /index.html by default. It gives a 404 error
  if a location can't be found, but you can changes this behaviour by
  setting a property in jumpers.xml.

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml.

- In Resin the mmbase-taglib is not fully working, because extensive tag-instance reuse causes the
  $-variable evalution in attributes to work always. This will be fixed in 1.6.1.
  Because Resis provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, also on this area are some known
  problems.

- Some details can't autodetect the context in which MMBase is running
   (like gui-functions of images), so it adviced to explicitely inform
   MMBase with the mmbase.htmlrooturlpath context parameter from web.xml.

============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsql database and driver.


=========
Tested on:
=========

The applications listed here are known to be tested with MMBase, but
the list is probably a lot bigger :-)
