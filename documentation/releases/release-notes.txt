============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------
[1.6.4]
- jsp editors: 
  - you can now create an object as you add a relation.
  - Added a shortlist option for the editors to make the pages a bit
    more userfriendly (wish #6062).
  - Fills in default age.
- Security: Rank has been backported from cvs-head. You can create
  your own ranks now.
- A CharacterEncodingFilter has been added. This can be used to set
  the character encoding of a request if the browser didn't set
  one. To use it, uncomment the lines in the web.xml. 

[1.6.3]
- added ConvertDummy class, which can be used if ImageMagic or JAI are unavailable
  ConvertDummy does not convert iamges, but does allow use of images and the image servlet.
- org.mmbase.util.HttpPost has it's own configuration file. It can be
  used to configure the maxfilesize property.

[1.6.2]
 - getRelatedNodes speedup, avoiding databasequeries when casting to actual type
 - Inheritance support in relations. It is possible to define
 object->object (related) now!
 - %k (to log memory usage) in MMPatternLayout

[1.6.1]
 This is a bugfix release, so no new features

[1.6.0]
- Introduction of `MMBaseServlet' with specialisations like ImageServlet and
  AttachmentServlet.
  There's no need for servdb anymore. Note that ImageServlet does not accept a
  'transformation'-template like the 'servdb' servlet of previous MMBase
  versions did. This functionality can be accessed by the imagetag or the 'cache'
  function of an image node.
- Editwizards. A way to define `task oriented' editors in XML.
- Improved support for Oracle
- Added the 'storage' classes. The storage classes are a new (yet experimental)
  interface for adding database support. Supported databases are mysql
  and postgresql.
  The database configuration classes for these implentations are
  relational.xml and postgresql.xml.
  These database layers automatically add indexes, and provide
  database support for deep builder inheritance.
- A lot of new documentation has been added to this release. This
  documentation has been created using the docbook-format.
- Character encoding is configurable
- Scan has been turned off by default
- Centralized caches configuration (caches.xml)
- Automatic builder installation for applications
- auto detection of some databases (see
  <mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/modules/mmbaseroot.xml> for more info)
- Use of webapplication server resources (JNDI)
- DTD's are available in the jar (and removed from the config dir)
- Richtext 0.5
- Security 1.0
- Builder extension (not completely finished)


------------------------
Editwizard New Features:
------------------------
[1.6.4]
- Added search facilities to the editwizard list page. 
- Made the error page configurable. 
- Added the searchdir attribute to list and relation creation
  tags. 
- Made optionlist sortable.
- Added the forcesearch attribute (see wish #6079).
- Added list attribute "destinationtype' to replace 'destination'
  (destination still available for backward-compatiblity)
- improved searchbox, so you can now search on owner and number
- added search-type attribute to allow for more search posibilities
- dtd version has been upgraded to 1.1


--------------------------
Documentation New Features:
--------------------------
[1.6.4]
- Documentation has been improved a lot.

[1.6.3]
[1.6.2]

  docbook.stylesheet=xhtml/docbook.xsl in build.properties, for
  old-style documentation

[1.6.1]
- Added first draft of a taglib tutorial.


---------------------
MMCI New Features:
---------------------
[1.6.4]
- ContextProvider.getDefaultCloudContext() has been backported from
  cvs-head to make it easier to port applications to MMBase-1.6.4

========
Upgrade:
========
[1.6.4]
- Replace mmbase.jar
- Replace editwizard jsp and xsl files
- Replace jsp editor files and/or replace my_editor files

[1.6.3]
- Replace mmbase.jar
- Add httppost.xml configuration file to config/utils dir

[1.6.2]
- Replace mmbase.jar
- upgrade jsp-editors

[1.6.1]
- On a deployment server upgrading from 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 can be done by
  replacing the mmbase.jar.
- On other systems: there has been one bugfix in the editwizards
  examples and some documentation has been fixed/added.

[1.6.0]
When you're upgrading from a previous MMBase-version it's important to
know there have been made a few changes in the xml configuration of
the builders:
- name parameter added to the builder tag
- extends parameter added to the builder tag
- descriptions/description tags added to the field tag


========================
Known Issues and Problems:
========================
[1.6.4]
- RMMCI will fail on JDK-1.4.x when using an JDK-1.3.x compiled
  mmbase.jar (ie the default distribution). You will need an
  mmbase.jar compiled with JDK-1.4.x.
- There has been a lot of confusion about the different databaselayers
  (storage vs databasesupport) and their status. At this moment
  there's no clear overview of all the different implementations. This
  will be solved with the MMBase-1.7.0 release, which will contain a
  completely rewritten databaselayer.
- Builder inheritance is still a new feature and has not fully been
  implemented in all database implementations (it has been implemented
  in most of the 'storage' classes). 
  If an implementation doesn't fully support inheritance, the
  following is true if mynews extends news:
  - new mynews nodes don't appear in news
  - mynews allows the same relations as news
- It's best to move all mmbase-webapp/WEB-INF/lib/x* jars to
  tomcat/common/endorsed and remove the ones already in this
  directory. 

[1.6.2]
- XXXX The jsp-editor update might also have solved the tomcat 4.0 issue?
- Builder inheritance fails with
  mysql-connector-java-3.0.6-stable-bin.jar, see bug #5968 for more information.
- With ImageMagick 5.4.8 and jdk 1.4 uploading images can go wrong,
  see bug #5877 for more information.
- There is no decent way to become administrator with basicsecurity,
  so the adminpages aren't working, see bug #5686 for more information

[1.6.1]
- No known issues solved
- The following bugfix was mistakenly added to the 1.6.0 releasenotes:
  "Performance issue resolved regarding MMObjectNode::getRelated() and
  MMObjectNode::getRelated(type) where type is a builder". It will be
  fixed in MMBase-1.6.2.

[1.6.0]
- There's a problem when using the scan-editors and the storageclasses
  with mysql. See bug #4452 for more information and for a workaround.
- Jsp-editors aren't working completly when using Tomcat 4.0.x, you'll
  get an "Illegal target of jump or branch"-error when trying to add
  relations. You could try the my_editors as an alternative or upgrade
  to Tomcat 4.1.x.
- Builder inheritance has been added in MMInformix42Node, this is an
  experimental feature.
- When using Tomcat 4.1.12 mmbase-logs are written into cataline.out
  and localhost_log. This has been fixed in Tomcat 4.1.17.
- Some versions of Orion doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3, because of this the
  jumpersFilter will not work. This is true for Orion 1.5.2 and older
  versions. You will need to remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

  You also need to add:
    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  to orion-web.xml

- MMBase doesn't compile when using J2SE 1.4, you have to change 2
  files by hand: MultiConnection.java and MultiStatement.java (both in
  the <org/mmbase/modules/database>-dir). Uncomment the methods for
  J2SE 1.4, more information is provided in the javadocs in these files.

  When using 1.4 the ant build will inform you about this.

- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-complient, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Html isn't html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes a servlet-engine won't stop when running MMBase, if you're
  using the shutdown script provided by the servlet-engine. This is
  caused by the fact that the jvm won't quit if there are non-daemon
  threads running. The only way to stop the servlet-engine is to kill
  it.

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerfull when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers don't jump to /index.html by default. It gives a 404 error
  if a location can't be found, but you can changes this behaviour by
  setting a property in jumpers.xml.

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml.

- In Resin the mmbase-taglib is not fully working, because extensive tag-instance reuse causes the
  $-variable evalution in attributes to work always. This will be fixed in 1.6.1.
  Because Resis provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, also on this area are some known
  problems.

- Some details can't autodetect the context in which MMBase is running
  (like gui-functions of images), so it adviced to explicitely inform
  MMBase with the mmbase.htmlrooturlpath context parameter from web.xml.


============
Requirements:
============
MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.


=========
Tested on:
=========
The applications listed here are known to be tested with MMBase, but
the list is probably a lot bigger :-)
