		<title>Introduction</title>
		<para>
			This document will describe in what way MMBase is documented, and how you can contribute to
			updating or adding to the MMBase documentation. But first have a look at the overview of available MMBase documentation and how it is organized. The documentation is mainly written for different target groups. Documents of one target group may be important for other target groups as well. For instance, backend and frontend developers will have also have to be familiar with the documents on builders and applications.
		</para>

		<para>
			There are several sources of documentation and information available. There are a few
			web-sites of the MMBase project (www.mmbase.org, foundation.mmbase.org, design.mmbase.org),
			which do supply knowledge and examples. The examples and HTML documentation which are shipped
			with an MMBase distro are available in the MMBase CVS source repository. The examples pages
			are in the html/mmexamples module, so new examples must be added there.
		</para>
		<para>
			Formal documentation is availabe in the `docbook' XML format in the `documentation' modules of
			the CVS repository.
		</para>
		<para>
			Some older documentation, which was not yet converted or rewritten to the docbook format is
			available in html/mmdocs of CVS.

		<para>
			Documentation is set up in articles. An article needs an articleinfo object that describes the content.
			Article info should contain :
	<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>
						A title.  you do not need to specify the title in article if you
						specify it in articleinfo. (it's not wrong but it's not
						needed either)
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>A date. Lets use one format for dates. The current format in most
						documentation is of the type 'December 5, 2002'.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						An edition tag with a  &dollar;Id:&dollar; content, for versioning of
						the data.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						An author group, with the authors. You can add an affiliation
						(organisation) and your own name. Please do not add editors, links, or
						other stuff, as it will all be displayed in the documentation header and
						that may be a bit overkill (maybe we have to override the
						docbook xsl).

			Use section, &dollar;not sect1, sect2...
			And, if possible, use CDATA sections in your &lt;programlisting&gt;. This
			makes it easier to read when editing. CDATA sections look like this:
		 <programlisting>
&lt;programlisting format="linespecific"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[

	&lt;sample code&gt;

		<title>Docbook editors</title>
		<para>Several docbook-editors are available. A number of editors used by the MMbase documentation team:</para>
		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				<para>Jedit</para>
				<para>Jedit is a Java-based text editor that uses colorcoding to ease edting of source code, such as java code, xml/html, and css. It provides a number of useful macros and plugins, including xml validaton, tag completion, and xml auto-formatting.</para>
				<para>Has some issues: it is a bit slow and occasionally freezes up, but it provides auto-save facilities and can recover after a crash. A good color-coded editor that works on all java-supporting platforms</para>

			<listitem>
				<para>Emacs</para>
				<para>
          A multi-platform open-source editor that provides several
          handholds for editing. It has an XML-mode with
          tag- and attribute completion, which makes creating valid
          Docbook documents easy.

			<listitem>
				<para>XXE</para>
				<para>A Java tool that allows you to edit xml files (only), specifically docbook xmls. It provides ways to associate a stylesheet with a xml so it can render a pleasing presentation of the docbook while you edit it.</para>
				<para>While being visually pleasing, XXE does not seem to handle or allow edit of CDATA sections well. It does not easily provide nice formatted xml, which makes the results hard to read in other editors. It also adds links to stylesheets and dtds using file:// paths, which you need to remove or correct later on.</para>
