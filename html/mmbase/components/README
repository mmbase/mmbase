This directory is the default location for component blocks implemented as JSP.

This directory contains subdirectories wich correspond to the names of MMBase components.  All Jsps
in a certain subdirectory <component name> (and subdirectories) should produce precisely one
component block 'div', and be referred to in a component XML (in <config dir>/components/<component
name>.xml).
