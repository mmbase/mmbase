    <h2>Welcome to MMBase Content management system.</h2>
    <h3>You are running version: <mm:cloudinfo type="mmbaseversion" /></h3>
    <p>
      If you are running on the binary distribution: It is shipped with a database that is
      written in Java: <a href="http://www.hsqldb.org">Hsqldb</a>, configured for <strong>memory
      only</strong>.  MMBase does support both commercial and opensource databases and you must
      make a decision on which database you want to run an actual site. You can use HSQL for
      that, but you must configure it to write it's data to disk then. HSQL is useable for small
      and simple sites, for bigger sites consider something like MySQL or Postgresql.

      If you wish to build your own MMBase version from the sourcecode, you are encouraged to
      download the <em>source distribution</em>.
