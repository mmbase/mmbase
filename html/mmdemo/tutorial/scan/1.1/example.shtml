<!-- we had to use a trick in this first example because as explained
we have no idea what number Rob has in this cloud, just replace $ PARAM1
with the number you want to reques, and read 1.1 - 1.3 -->

$MOD-MMBASE-FIELD-$PARAM1-firstname
$MOD-MMBASE-FIELD-$PARAM1-lastname
$MOD-MMBASE-FIELD-$PARAM1-email
