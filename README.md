# MMBase on Github!
This is the code originally maintained by the subversion repository on http://scm.mmbase.org/view/

MMBase is the CMS we worked on in the 00's (it was open sourced in 2000). It kind of died more or less  around 2012. The site subversion and maven repositories are still up, but I suppose that will not be for ever.

I decided to migrate the code to github now, and may be split it up a bit. I may even start to reuse some code. I e.g. would sometimes still like to use the taglib. 

So I just started to split out the monolithic repository 'mmbase' the parts I suppose might still be usefull, and make them available via maven central.

# MMBase
MMBase is an object relational mapping tool to build advanced flexible Java based web applications with strong multi media features. MMBase was originally developed by the Dutch broadcast company VPRO but has been open source since March 2000.
