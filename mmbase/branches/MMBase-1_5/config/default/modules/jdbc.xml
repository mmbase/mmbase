	     name="url"  defines the jdbc url mmbase will use to connect to your database
    	 it can use the following vars

	     $HOST , set by <host>
    	 $PORT , set by <port>
	     $DBM  , set by <database>

    	 this way we can provide the url for several databases and you only need to

      	<!--
	    name="user", what is the user we will use to login to the database, if set to 'url' it
    	will use one defined with the 'url' command above this is needed for several
	    databases including mysql.
     	 -->

	    name="database", most database engines allow you to store multiple databases in one
    	engine we need to select the database root we want to use within this engine.
	    make sure you are using a 'empty' database when you start using mmbase to make
    	sure you don't create problems for other users of the database engine you are
	    using.

      	<!--
	    name="connections",  mmbase does its own database connection pooling
    	(keeping connections to the database open over several database
	    query's, to speed up query's by not logging in and closing
    	the connection on every qeury). 'connections' allows you to set
	    the number of connections mmbase keeps open to the database.

	    name="querys", mmbase will replace these connections every x query's
    	because alot of the databases drivers, jdbc drivers etc etc have
	    memory leaks or other possible problems. with 'querys' you can set
    	the number that will be done per connection before it gets replaced
