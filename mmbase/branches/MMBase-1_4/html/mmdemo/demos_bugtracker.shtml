			Bugtracker is a working/active application as used on the www.mmbase.org sites to maintain bug reports of mmbase. It included several parts that makes it a good example. It uses the cookies/users objects to create a community of people who have entered bugs, commitors and maintainers who solve the bugs. It uses tcp (temp. cloud manager) to change/update the bugreports and login system. It mails the people on changes using the mail object and sendmail module. For now just look at the hints given below and look at the webpages it includes in the future we might include docs on the seperate parts.

			Bugtrackers object cloud (that might be part of a bigger cloud) uses 7 builders, 3 systems.<BR><BR>
			The first consists of the builders pools, bugreports and mmevents, they make up the core of the bugtracker. Within a given pool (say mmbase bugs or netscape bugs) you have relations to several bugreports that have relations to when it was reported,updated etc etc<BR><BR>
			The second is the login system, this is the basic cookie/user system of mmbase extended with the groups builder so we can relate the users to different groups of users (interested, submittors). In this example users can be attached to bugreports for email etc etc<BR><BR>
			The last part is only one builder called mail, its used by the login system and the bugreport builder to create emails for new users and mail to changed on the bugreports. The mail object is used in 'one-shot' mode meaning that once its created by tcp it mails itself and then deletes itself from the cloud.

			The bugtracker can be used by several groups of people : viewers/users, commitors and the admin. Its a easy app to use so ill make a short remark on all 3.<BR><BR>
			As a user the bugtracker has 2 modes in not logged in mode you can look at the outstanding bugs, search on them etc etc. Only once you register you can submit new bugs and attach yourself to outstanding bugs (so you receive mail on changes).<BR><BR>
			As a commitor you can not only view and submit reports but you can also change the state of a bugreport, this includes its description, what people are the maintainers, who is interested etc etc. Commitors should change the rationale at the end of each change of a bugreport since that will trigger a mail to all attached users.<BR><BR>
		The mmbase could admin, can use the normal editors (if he/she wants) to change all the objects (delete them too) and can upgrade normal users to commitors by creating a relation between a user object and the group bugtracker commitors.
