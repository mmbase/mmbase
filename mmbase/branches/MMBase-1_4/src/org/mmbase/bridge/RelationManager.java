/**
 * This interface represents a relation constraint (or contex, if you like).
 * More specifically, it represents a relation manager (itself a node manager) as it applies between bnode belonging to
 * two other node managers.
 * Some of the information here is retrieved from the NodeManager used to build the catual relation node
 * (the data as described in the xml builder config file). This NodeManager is also referred to as the parent.
 * Other data is retrieved from a special (hidden) object that decsribes what relations apply between two nodes.
 * (formerly known as the TypeRel builder).
 * This includes direction and cardinality, and the NodeManagers of nodes itself. These fields cannot be changed
 * except through the use of an administration module.
 * This interface is therefor not a real mmbase 'object' in itself - it exists of two objects joined together.
