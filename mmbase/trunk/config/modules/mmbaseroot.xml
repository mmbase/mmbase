  <!-- <properties>
  You can define properties to be used by the classfile.
  The properties described here are mandatory.

  <properties>
	
	<!--
	name="machinename" defines the name that is used in the mmbase cluster,
	it is used for the mmservers objects. Make sure that this is different
	for each node in your cluster. This is not the machines dns name
	(as defined by host as name or ip number).
	-->
	<property name="machinename">MMBaseserver</property>

	<!--
	name="storagemanagerfactory" defines what factory to use for accessing the storage devices.
	Currently. only DatabaseStorageManagerFactory is implemented, which gives access to various database devices
        using JDBC. 
        Uncomment this property to use the storagemanagerfactory code, rather than te old (soon to be depricated) 
	support classes.
	-->
	<!-- property name="storagemanagerfactory">org.mmbase.storage.implementation.database.DatabaseStorageManagerFactory</property -->

	<!--
	name="database" defines which database we are using as defined in your config
	databases directory (default : org/mmbase/config/default/databases/). It
	is defined by a xml file for example sql92.xml or mysql.xml. This should
	be set in combo with the jdbc.xml files (where you define the database
	server and how to connect to it.

	sql92 for default SQL92 database (normally not used)
	mysql for MySQL (www.mysql.com)
	informix for Informix Universal Server (www.informix.com)

	** remark : more database are supported or are easy to support, check
	www.mmbase.org's howto's on this we will complete this list
	as soon as possble **
        
            MyQSL:          mysql
            PostgrSQL:      postgresql71
            HyperSonic:     hypersonic

        <!--
            TODO: Why is this setting not in the jdbc.xml?

	<!-- property name="database">mysql</property -->

	<!--
	name="multicasthost" mmbase nodes in a cluster use multicast to talk to
	eachother this defines what 'channel' we are talking to its now set
	to the default local network so unless you know what you are doing
	leave it to ALL-SYSTEMS.MCAST.NET.
        
        When you want to disable the communication between different MMBase-instances,
        (log message builder xxx not found, can be annoying), leave the value empty:
	else use a multicat IP address like this
	<property name="multicasthost">224.0.0.1</property>
	-->
	<property name="multicasthost"></property><!-- ALL-SYSTEMS.MCAST.NET -->

	<!--
	name="multicastport" on what port does this multicast talking between nodes
	take place, This can be set to any port but check if something else on
	your network is allready using multicast when you have problems.
	-->
	<property name="multicastport">16080</property>
	
	<!--
	name="host" the host or ip number of the machine this mmbase node is
	running on. Its important that this name is set correctly because its
	used for communication between mmbase nodes and external devices
	(xml or jini based).
	-->
	<property name="host">127.0.0.1</property>

	<!--
	name="authtype" defines what authorisation type is used, This is a plugin
	system at the moment we only support 2 types :

	none (only perform name/password checks based on accounts.properties)

	basic (use the default authorisation system, based on groups and
	relations see the install/example docs how to enable this DON'T
	set it before creating the needed tables/objects as defined in these docs).
	-->
	<property name="authtype">none</property>

	<!--
	name="dtdbase" defines the homebase for the DTD's used by the objects
	(urls, cdtracks, images etc etc). Normally this is set to
	www.mmbase.org but you can aim it to your own system if you defined
	extra objects yourself. Its not used at the moment for anything vital.
	-->
	<property name="dtdbase">http://www.mmbase.org/dtd/</property>

	<!--
	name="basename" You can have multiple mmbase systems inside your database
	if you want this can be very handy when testing of for running multiple
	setups inside one database its added as a preset to all your table names
	like : BASENAME=test will result in table names like test_object and
	test_urls.
	-->
	<property name="basename">mm</property>

	<!--
	name="language" defines the language for the gui. The standard gui information for the
	editors can be found in /config/modules/mmlanguage.xml. The gui information of a builder
	is provided by the builder itself (e.g. /config/builders/urls.xml).
	-->
	<property name="language">nl</property>

	<!-- 
	name="encoding" 

	The encoding to be used in the database (if the database layer
	needs to know), and for use as default for the pages.  Recommended
	is 'UTF-8', since this can be used for virtually every language on
	the world, and is a superset of ASCII.
	
	Default though, it is ISO-8859-1, to ensure backwards
	compatibility. Perhaps this will change to UTF-8 once this is
	tested well.  
	-->
        <!-- since, when not mentioned it will be ISO-8859-1, all new systems will get urf-8 -->
