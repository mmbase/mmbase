  <!--
      Queries are logged with the logger with name 'org.mmbase.QUERIES'.
      the level of logging is determinged by the following duration thresholds (in ms, but it is measured in ns, so you can use decimals).

      If a query took shorter than 'debug' it will be logged on level 'trace'.
      If a query took longer than that, it will be logged on 'debug', unless it took even
      longer that 'service', in which case it will be logged on 'service', and so on.
