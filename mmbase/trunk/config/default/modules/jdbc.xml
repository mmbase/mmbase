            name="url"  defines the jdbc url mmbase will use to connect to your database
            it can use the following vars

        $HOST , set by <host>
            $PORT , set by <port>
        $DBM  , set by <database>

            this way we can provide the url for several databases and you only need to
         set the above variables.

        databases including mysql.

        name="database", most database engines allow you to store multiple databases in one
            engine we need to select the database root we want to use within this engine.
        make sure you are using a 'empty' database when you start using mmbase to make
            sure you don't create problems for other users of the database engine you are
        using.

        name="connections",  mmbase does its own database connection pooling
            (keeping connections to the database open over several database
        query's, to speed up query's by not logging in and closing
            the connection on every qeury). 'connections' allows you to set
        the number of connections mmbase keeps open to the database.

        when you run mmbase on the same machine as this mmbase node it can
            be set to 'localhost'

            because alot of the databases drivers, jdbc drivers etc etc have
        memory leaks or other possible problems. with 'querys' you can set
            the number that will be done per connection before it gets replaced
        with a new connection.
