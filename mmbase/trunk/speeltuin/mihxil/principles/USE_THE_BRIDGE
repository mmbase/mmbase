Architectural theme: Technical
Principle: Use the bridge
Qualification:
Explanation:
	When using Java code to communicate to MMBase one should only use the bridge interfaces.
Argumentation:
        In this way you seperate MMBase core code from your own code. This gives core developers
	more freedom. Your code is less prone to break on update of MMBase. The bridge is a subset
	of all MMBase classes, so it is easier.
	
	By using bridge, you also automaticly use MMBase security. We want that all exposed mmbase
	data  is subject to security.

Consequence:
        The following classes from the org.mmbase package can be used (this list is maintained in
	the build script of RMMCI)
	org/mmbase/bridge/*
	org/mmbase/bridge/util/**
        org/mmbase/storage/search/*
        org/mmbase/datatypes/**
        org/mmbase/security/UserContext
        org/mmbase/security/AuthenticationData*
        org/mmbase/security/Rank
        org/mmbase/security/SecurityException.class

        org/mmbase/util/functions/**

        org/mmbase/cache/CachePolicy*
        org/mmbase/cache/Cache*

        org/mmbase/util/**   
	/only if they themselves obey this principle

        org/mmbase/storage/Storable.class
        org/mmbase/storage/StorageException.class

        org/mmbase/core/util/Fields
        org/mmbase/core/*
        org/mmbase/core/event/**


Allowed Implementations:
	Implements can use the above classes. Normally they should not instantiate them though.
