    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      MMBase has a pluggable security system. This means the object level security can be
      implemented on several ways. This document describes the 'cloud context' implementation for
      MMBase security.      
    </para>
    <para>
      The default security implementation for several MMBase releases was the normal 'context'
      security. This security implementation defines users, groups and so-called 'security
      contexts'. See also the documentation for 'context security configuration'.
    </para>
    <para>
      Often it is desirable to have a more dynamic security implementation which is more readily
      configurable than by opening an XML file on the server in your text editor. It would be nice
      if the concepts and relations described in this XML file could be modeled using MMBase
      objects and relation. Then security could be administrated in the same way MMBase nodes can be
      edited.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="object model">
    <title>Object model</title>
    <para>
      Because of the nature of this security implementation, the object model of your MMBase
      installation must be enriched with several new object types and relations types. This section
      describes the object model needed for this security implemenation.

    </para>
    <section id="contexts">
      <title>Contexts</title>
      <para>
        All security contexts are represented in the 'mmbase-contexts' node manager. A certain context
        can grant the several security operations ('create', 'read', 'write', 'delete', 'change
        context') to groups or directly to users. This goes by the role 'grant' between mmbase-context
        and mmbaseusers and mmbasegroups.
      </para>
      <para>
        To which other security contexts a context of a certain node may be changed is fixed by the
        'allowed' relation between contexts objects (this feature it turned off on default).
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="groups">
      <title>Groups</title>
      <para>
        Security contexts can grant rights to groups, modeled by the 'mmbasegroups' node
        manager. Groups can contain other groups (with the 'contains' relations). Such 'contained'
        groups inherit all rights.
      </para>
      <para>
        Groups of course also can contain actual users. And users of course inherit their rights
        from the groups they are in.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="users">
      <title>Users</title>
      <para>
        Users are represented by 'mmbaseusers' objects. Users authorize themselves with
        username/password combinations which are fields of this node manager (the password is stored
        md5 encrypted in the database).
      </para>
      <para>
        Security contexts can also attribute rights directly to users.
      </para>
      <para>
        User objects can have several statuses. A user can be 'active', 'new' or 'blocked'.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="ranks">
      <title>Ranks</title>
      <para>
        Besides the default ranks of the security frame-work, more ranks can be defined. This can be
        used to block low ranked users to certain parts of your site.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="buildernaming">
      <title>Naming</title>
      <para>
        The builders are for legacy reasons called 'mmbaseusers', 'mmbasegroups', 'mmbasecontexts',
        'mmbaseranks'. But because these things are essentially related to 
        security (rather then to 'mmbase' which is a bit of a non-statement in this context..) the
        gui names of these builders will start with 'security' rather then with
        'mmbase'. So in generic editors you wil see them listed under 's' rather then under 'm'.
      </para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="editors">
    <title>Security editors</title>
    <para>
      If you know the object model sufficiently well, security can now be administrated by using
      'generic' editors. Cloud context security is however shipped with specialized editors.
    </para>
    <para>
      <figure>
        <title>The Cloud Context Security Editors</title>
        <screenshot>
          <graphic fileref="editors.png"/>
        </screenshot>
      </figure>
      These editors work only in MMBase-1.7 (and upwards). They are implemented as 'pieces of
      html', which makes it possible to include the entire editors into other
      editors (I use this to integrate them in the editors for a certain site),
      and you can configure extra links for users (e.g. make a link to a 'people'
      editwizard to relate people objects to accounts). There is an index.jsp
      available to use them stand-alone. 
    </para>
    <para>
      When defining a new 'context' object with the security editors, it might be convenient to
      allow read rights on it to most or all users. To facilitate this, this editors looks for a group with 
      alias 'mayreadallgroup' when creating a context object, and if it exists the read operation is
      automaticly link to it immediately.
    </para>
    <para>
      Often you would want to associate a context with every 'group' of users, so on the creation of
      one of those, you get the option to create to other one in one go.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="extraadmins">
    <title>'Extra' administration accounts</title>
    <para>
      Normally the cloud context security should be configured completely in itself. But it is
      e.g. possible to forget the admin password or so, and then you could not do certain things any
      more. You could fix it by temporary disabling security in security.xml and then reset the
      admin password.
    </para>
    <para>
      This would however temporary let anybody in your web site, and it would be very
      vulnarable, in that time. When you switch it on then again, then all user have to login again,
      which is also a (however small) disadvantage. Therefore we have provided an extra feature, which we
      could refer to as 'extra administrators', which works by use of a property file
      'admins.properties' in &lt;config dir&gt;/security/admins.properties. This property file contains name/password combinations of
      'extra' administrators. The file is dynamically loaded and checked (you can change it, place
      it, remove it), so you can add and remove such administrators on a running MMBase (without affecting 'normal' users).  So as long as you
      have access to the file system, you can in this way always administrate you site running Cloud
      Context Security, in a reasonably secure way.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section id="otheroptions">
    <title>Other configuration</title>
    <para>
      Some other things can be configured in cloud context secuity. These setting are available as 'properties' in the builder xml of mmbasecontexts.
      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>readall</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              If you don't care for read protection, you can considerably simplify configuration
              by setting this property to 'true'. Every object may always be read by every
              user. This should also have a possitive effect on the performance impact of
              security.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>allcontextspossible</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Setting this to false, would make it possible to implement a simple kind of workflow
              using security, because then you must explicitily indicate which context may be changed to
              which other contexts explicitely. Unpublished nodes can then be owned by a security
              context which does not allow reading by everybody. You can arrange then that the
              context can only be changed in one direction (to publish). The security editors do currently
              not support this (no way to link to next context)
            </para>
            <para>
              If this property is true (the default), then you may change any object (on which you
              have the 'change context' right, to any other context (which you can see).
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>maxcontextsinquery</term>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              When checking read rights, in the query things like 'WHERE owner in (&lt;list of contexts&gt;)' can
              appear. This property is an indication for how much the query may (expressed in the number of times
              one contexts is added to the query) grow. If the query would have to be more complex this is not
              done, but the result would need checking. This means also that the result of a 'count'
              on a query might not be excactly right any more, because it might have counted some
              objects which you are not allowed to actually read.
            </para>
            <para>
              Warnings will be issued in the log when this number is too small (an postprocessing of
              query-results is needed), which you can solve in several ways. Firstly you can
              increase this property. You can also simply the used query (perhaps it has
              an extraordinary lot of steps), and lastly you could also make sure that there is for
              any user only a limited number of contexts which he can see or a limited number of
              contexts which he can not see (the query must contain for every step either contain a
              list of all 'invisible' contexts or all 'visibile' contexts).
            </para>
            <para>
              This property defaults to 50.
            </para>
