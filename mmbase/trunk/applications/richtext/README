To install MMBase richtext:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You need a servlet 2.4 application server like Tomcat 5. Youre web.xml must be version 2.4 (to
   enable EL)
- You need MMBase 1.8, complete with the shipped jstl.jar and standard.jar

then:

- Place from web-app/WEB-INF/lib  mmbase-richtext.jar, kupu-i18n.jar and mmbase-kupu-i18n.jar in
   your WEB-INF/lib.
- Copy everyting from the directory /mmbase. It contains a directory 'kupu' and one css in mmbase/style/css.
- (Re)start MMBase.

To install the demo:

- Copy the directory web-app/templates, e.g. to <your web-app>/richtext
- Use your browser to see the index.jspx and read it.



To compile MMBase richtext from sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the complete rich text package, you also need to check out kupu and build it. This happens
automaticly by the ant script in this directory.

But it needs the following command-line tools
- make
- tools from gettext (to compile the i18n jars)
- xsltprc  (libxml2, libxslt, used to compose the kupu-page from .kupu source). I tried to use xalan
   here, but no luck.
