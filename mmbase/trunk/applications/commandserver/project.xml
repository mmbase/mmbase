  <shortDescription>MMBase Commandserver utility</shortDescription>
  <description>
    Very small java application that allows you to execute command-line applications from a seperate java process. This is because the System.execute call needs to fork() on unix OS-es, which means the executed command allocates just as much memory as the entire java JVM has allocated.
