The VPRO runs MMBase 1.8. Since I don't feel like making every improvement trice, these are patches to apply to compile the trunk of clustering against
MMBase 1.8 classes (a few details need to be different).

Also the version in the pom is changed to reflect that this is clustering 2.0 combined with mmbase18.
