   <!--
    name="channelproperties"  Long string with all properties of a JChannel protocol stack. 
    Whitespaces and carriage returns are ignored. May be used for readability.

    Sets the properties as used by the channel to set up the protocol stack.
    The stack below is a copy of the default stack as used by a JChannel (see the JChannel.java 
    source code). 

    See JGroups documentation for explanation of each of the layers in the 
    protocol stack. Important to have every layer, otherwise stack setup will fail, 
    and no multicast will be available. Recommend only changing mcast_addr, mcast_port and ip_ttl.

    JGroups automatically fragments large message. Datagramsize is therefore not needed.
    
    MERGE2 is set for the following reason:
    When a network error occurs, the cluster might be partitioned into
    several different partitions. JGroups has a MERGE service that allows
    the coordinators in partitions to communicate with each other and form a
    single cluster back again.
