  <description>
    With the Crontab application you can create scheduled tasks in MMBase, that need to run on specified intervals. These are fully manageable in MMBase if the 'crontabs' builder is installed. Ideal if you need to write scripts that need to perform imports or cleanups at regular intervals.
