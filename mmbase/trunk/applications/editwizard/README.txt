These are the MMBase editwizards.

To install:

- Place mmbase-editwizard.jsp in your WEB-INF/lib
- The 'templates' directory from the web-app contain the jsp's and xsl's needed to run the
  editwizards.
  The examples in 'examples' suppose this templates directory to be <web-app>/mmapps/editwizard, but
  we hope that this can be configurable.
