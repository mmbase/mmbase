    <title>The MMBase media project</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
     The MMBase media projects define an object model to represent
     meta data for 'media' formats like real audio streams and mp3
     files. The necessary builder implementations can be find in the
     'builders' subpackage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides descriptive texts and other useful information it also
     models 'fragments' from streams, which is particular useful when
     you want to generate Smil or otherwise want to show something a
     small part of the entire stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the same content can be available as several streams,
      (think small-band/broad-band, more servers), there is
      functionality to make the selection which of the result URL's to
      offer. This functionality can be found in the 'filters' subpackage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generating the actual URL can also be done in several ways, and
      this is modelled by use of 'URLComposer's. Some URL's for
      example can contain start and stop times, titles etc. Perhaps
      only one mmbase object number is sufficient if the url points to
      e.g. a MMBase servlet. Which kind of URLComposer to use in which
      cases is determined by the URLComposerFactory class.
