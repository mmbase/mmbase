  <!-- Maybe in a later stage we can define her things according to the creation 
        of urls (real, media player, etc.)

   mm: I think this file can be removed

	<!-- This will arrange the mimetype mapping according to the format/codec. 
		You can use wildcards, the most strict mapping will have priority. 
  i.e. format"ogg" codec="vorbis" will be prefered to format="*"
		codec="*"

  Moved to a seperate file:
  -->
	<mimemapping>
		<map format="ra" codec="*">audio/x-pn-realaudio</map>
		<map format="rm" codec="*">application/x-pn-realmedia</map>
		<map format="ogg" codec="vorbis">audio/x-vorbis</map>
		<map format="ogg" codec="*">application/x-ogg</map>
		<map format="*" codec="*">audio/x-pn-realaudio</map>
    
	</mimemapping>
