  <shortDescription>MMBase 'Yahoo' example</shortDescription>
  <description>
    The MyYahoo application is one of the oldest MMBase examples that still exists. It shows you a very simple
    approach to a site containing URLs in categories.
    In its simplicity it is a good example to see how the basic MMBase taglib works.
