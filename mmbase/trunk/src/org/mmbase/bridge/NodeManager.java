/**
 * This interface represents a node's type information object - what used to be the 'builder'.

 * some information on deribed and deriving types. It also contains some maintenance code - code
 * to create new nodes, en code to query objects belonging to the same manager.
 * Since node types are normally maintained through use of config files (and not in the database),
 * as wel as for security issues, the data of a nodetype cannot be changed except through
 * the use of an administration module (which is why we do not include setXXX methods here).

     * Returns a list of nodes belonging to this node manager. Constraints can

     * uppercase letters for the operators and lowercase letters for the
     * fieldnames. Example constraints are:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "number = 100" (!=, <, >, <= and >= can also be used)
     * "name = 'admin'",
     * "email IS NULL" (indicating the email field is empty)
     * "email LIKE '%.org'" (indication the email should end with .org)
     * "number BETWEEN 99 AND 101"
     * "name IN ('admin', 'anonymous')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * The NOT operator can be used to get the opposite result like:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "NOT (number = 100)"
     * "NOT (name = 'admin')",
     * "email IS NOT NULL"
     * "email NOT LIKE '%.org'" (indication the email should not end with .org)
     * "number NOT BETWEEN 99 AND 101"
     * "name NOT IN ('admin', 'anonymous')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * Some special functions (not part of standard SQL, but most databases
     * support them) can be used like:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "LOWER(name) = 'admin'" (to also allow 'Admin' to be selected)
     * "LENGTH(name) > 5" (to only select names longer then 5 characters)
     * </pre>
     *
     * Constraints can be linked together using AND and OR:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "((number=100) OR (name='admin') AND email LIKE '%.org')"
     * </pre>
     *
     * The single quote can be escaped using it twice for every single
     * occurence:
     *
     * <pre>
     * "name='aaa''bbb'" (if we want to find the string aaa'bbb)
     * </pre>
     *
