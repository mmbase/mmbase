# While starting MMBase you can give MMBase four arguments
# -Dmmbase.config tells MMBase where to find the configuration files.
# -Dmmbase.htmlroot tells MMBase where to find the HTML root.
# -Dmmbase.outputfile tells MMBase to which file the output has to be redirected
# 		if this argument is ommited the output will be redirected to your screen.
# -Dmmbase.userlevel tells MMBase to which userlevel it has to switch
# 		this argument is used when you have to start mmbase with under 'root'
#		to be able to connect port 80, but after connecting to port 80 you want
#		MMBase to run under userid x.
#
# For more information about the arguments read MMBase argument in the system
# administration section at the www.mmbase.org site.
