welcome.text=<p>\
      If you are running on the binary distribution: It is shipped with a database that is \
      written in Java: <a href="http://www.hsqldb.org">Hsqldb</a>, configured for <strong>memory \
      only</strong>.  MMBase does support both commercial and opensource databases and you must \
      make a decision on which database you want to run an actual site. You can use HSQL for \
      that, but you must configure it to write it's data to disk then. HSQL is useable for small \
      and simple sites, for bigger sites consider something like MySQL or Postgresql.\

      If you wish to build your own MMBase version from the source code, you are encouraged to \
      use (anonymous) CVS access or use the <em>source distribution</em>.\
