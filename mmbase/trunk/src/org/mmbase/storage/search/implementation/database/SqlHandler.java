/**
 * Interface for handler classes that are used to create SQL string 
 * representations of {@link SearchQuery SearchQuery} objects.
 * <p>
 * A number of <code>SqlHandler</code> objects can create a chain of handlers,
 * following the <em>Chain Of Responsibility</em> design pattern.
 * <p>
 * In short: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>A chain is formed of <code>SqlHandler</code> objects, where each
 * element in the chain, except the last one, is called a <em>chained</em> 
 * handler. 
 * Each chained handler has a <em>successor</em>, which is the next element 
 * in the  chain.
 * <li>The first element receives all requests first (a <em>request</em> = 
 * call of one of the methods in the interface). 
 * When a chained element receives a request, it can either handle it or pass 
 * it on to its successor. 
 * <li>The last element in the chain, handles all remaining requests. 
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each handler in the chain adds functionality to its successor(s), 
 * in a way similar to subclassing. The chained design 
 * enables a chain of handlers to be configured and created
 * at runtime. 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the methods defined in the interface, the concrete 
 * <code>SqlHandler</code> class for the last element in the chain
 * is required to have a constructor with this signature:
 * <blockquote><code>
    public &lt;constructor&gt;(Map disallowedValues) { .. }
 * </code></blockquote>
 * where <code>disallowedValues</code> is a map that maps disallowed 
 * table/fieldnames to allowed alternatives.
 * <p>
 * The concrete <code>SqlHandler</code> class for the other, chained, 
 * elements in the chain are required to have a constructor 
 * with this signature:
 * <blockquote><code>
    public &lt;constructor&gt;(SqlHandler successor) { .. }
 * </code></blockquote>
 * where <code>successor</code> is the successor in the chain 
 * of responsibility.
