      The security infrastructure of MMBase. MMBase has a pluggable security system, which is
      currently called from within the bridge implementation.  The core of this setup are the
      abstract classes `Authorization' and `Authenication'.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several interesting security implementation available in a standard MMBase
      installation, but you can always implement your own. The implementations can be found in
      subpackages of org.mmbase.bridge.implementation.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
     The most powerful implementation is the 'context' implementation which supplies a a system of
     user, groups and 'contextes', which is configured by a sophisticated xml file.
    </li>
    <li>
     The default implementation however is the 'cloud' implementation which is a more simple simple
     system with only users (no groups) which are stored as MMBase objects, so you can administrate this with the normal MMBase edit tools.
   </li>
   </ul>
