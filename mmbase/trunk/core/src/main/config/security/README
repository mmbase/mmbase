This directory contains security related settings.
On default the security is configured with an xml in 'context/config.xml' (referred to by
security.xml).

When installing an other security implementation (like 'cloud context security'), it usually
suffices to make this directory empty, and place the relevant jar in WEB-INF/lib
(because such jars can contain there own security.xml).
