  <section id="installation">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
      Placing mmbase-poll.jar in WEB-INF/lib suffices to provide the needed builders, and tags to
      fully customize your own poll. The component blocks are implementation using JSP so those JSP
      can be installed too..
    </para>
    <para>
      Component blocks are only supported in MMBase versions beyond 1.8.  The rest of the
      functionality also works with MMBase 1.8. 
    </para>
    <para>
      An editwizard task definition is available in the directory 'tasks'.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="tags">
    <title>mm-pol tags</title>
    <para>
      Using 'tag-files' a few tags are defined by the poll contribution. They are available by the
      following URL: xmlns:mm-poll="http://www.mmbase.org/tags/mm/poll"
    </para>
    <section id="vote">
      <title>mm-poll:vote tag</title>
      <para>
        This tag explores the request, and handles a vote of a user.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section id="poll">
      <title>mm-poll:poll tag</title>
      <para>
        This tag explores whether the client already voted, and then iterates over the possible
        answers. It has a 'canvote' attribute which is executed if the client can still vote, and
        the jsp:body is execute if it cannot vote for the poll.
      </para>
      <para>
        This tag has a required attribute 'poll' to indicate about which poll it handles.
      </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="blocks">
    <title>Component blocks</title>
    <para>

      of the poll 'component'. The components generic admin pages of MMBase will give an overview of
      those block hence you have installed mmbase-poll.jar.
