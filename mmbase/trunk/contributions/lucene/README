MMBase lucene module provides an MMBase interface to lucene (http://lucene.apache.org), which is
about stand-alone (i.e. not by the database) indexing.


To install MMBase-lucene:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You need MMBase 1.8

- You need a servlet 2.4 compatible application server like Tomcat 5, to run the administration
  templates (not essential)


then:

- Copy WEB-INF/lib/mmbase-lucene.jar to your WEB-INF/lib

- Install the administration pages found in templates in your webdir, e.g. in '/mmbase/lucene' or
  '/mmbase/admin/lucene'

- Copy WEB-INF/config/utils/luceneindex.xml to your WEB-INF/config/utils and configure your indices
  in it (see documentation).

- If you have mmbase-crontab installed, you may want to schedule full indexing. See
  WEB-INF/config/utils/crontab.xml for an example. It is not absolutely necessary, because the index
  is kept up-to-date using MMBase events and so on.

- Restart your application server

Once installed you can still edit luceneindex.xml (changes will be noticed). Indices can be
triggered and tested using the templates.



Note: There is also a lucene module on mmapps.sourceforge.net: http://mmapps.sourceforge.net/lucenemodule/
