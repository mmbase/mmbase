The newsletter bundle is composed of several components that each provide a set of features to the
bundle. 
The newsletter bundle provides additional functionality to the CMS Container. This is done by adding
new portlets, modules and backend code. The newsletter bundle is not a seperate application layer on
top of the CMS Container, but integrates with the existing applications.
