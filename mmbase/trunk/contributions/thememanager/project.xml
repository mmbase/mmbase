  <description>
    The ThemeManager is a contribution that allows you to 'skin' a webapplication
    using css and image files. It comes with edit tools that allow you to assign
    themes to different projects and even edit css files from inside
    your web browser. 
    This code is currently being used by MMBob, but not used much by other projects.
    Therefore we do not recommend to use it heavily.
