Author: H. Hangyi

To install NatMM:
1. download and install MMBase 1.7.4 (see server.xml for example configuration of Tomcat)
2. clean the WEB-INF/config/applications folder
3. create a NatMM build
4. copy the files of NatMM build over the MMBase 1.7.4 webapp
4.a. change settings in WEB-INF/config/modules/jdbc.xml
4.b. change settings in WEB-INF/config/log/log4j.xml
4.c. copy the builders from WEB-INF/config/applications/NatMM/builders/ to  WEB-INF/config/builders/
4.d. if you want to use the templates in nmintra: 
     copy the builders from WEB-INF/config/applications/NMIntra/builders/ to  WEB-INF/config/builders/
4.e. change settings in WEB-INF/config/builders/images.xml (and style.xml, when using nmintra)
4.f. make sure to load the NatMM (and the NMIntra) applications. You can do this by change the setting
     for auto-deploy in application file to true or by using the admin console (/mmbase/admin) to load
     the application.

Notes: 
1. The NatMM application depends on an admin user with the alias users.admin. After installing you will first have
to create this user. You can do this by:
1.a. changing the setting for "security active" from true to false
1.b. restart Tomcat
1.c. add the alias users.admin to the admin user
1.d. changing the setting for "security active" from false to true
2. The NatMM application depends on a rubriek node with alias root. This is the root of your tree of websites. After
installing you will first have to create this rubriek.

Still to do: create application-data files to create a minimalistic website to be loaded into an empty database.
