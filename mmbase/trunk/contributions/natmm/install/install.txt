NatMM
Version: 06.03.06

NatMM is an MMBase application which is based on LeoCMS. Feature of LeoCMS (currently) not used in NatMM:
1. one click editing
2. workflow
3. versioning
4. notification
5. remote publishing

To install NatMM:
1. download and install MMBase 1.7.3 (see server.xml for example configuration of Tomcat)
2. clean the WEB-INF/config/applications folder
3. copy the files of NatMM over the MMBase 1.7.3 webapp
3.a. change settings in WEB-INF/config/modules/jdbc.xml
3.b. change settings in WEB-INF/config/log/log4j.xml
3.c. change settings in WEB-INF/config/builders/images.xml

Still to do: create application-data files to create a minimalistic website to be loaded into an empty database.
