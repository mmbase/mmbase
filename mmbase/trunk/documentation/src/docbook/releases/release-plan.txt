$Id$
===================================================================

TODO for 1.9.0 release of MMBase:

I Core/Project abstraction

- Tools: move utility classes, modules, and builders that are still useful to a tools application
  (or in case this is too hard, tag them for inclusion in a later release)


II - Cleaning

The following steps should be made to clean the code. Note that part of this is also done during abstraction

- cleaning of the html-dir
  DO

III Improvements

The following Core functionality will be evalued and (if needed and possible) improved in 1.9.  It
is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for
this one.

- Multicast: select an appropriate (or pluggable) communication system, solve issues with bursts of
  change events
  DO

- Modules and Builders: implement a proper way for loading, unloading, reloading, and shutting down
  modules and builders
  SKIP

IV Performance and Maintenance

Performance issues should be analyzed and if possible resolved. It is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for this one.
Performance and maintenance related issues are:

- Monitoring of MMBase performance issues, i.e. profiling
