---------------------------------------------------------
Known API incompatibilities of bridge, between 1.8 to 1.9.
---------------------------------------------------------

- Bridge. A RelationList is no NodeList any more (though a Relation is still a Node).

- Taglib. <mm:url generates object of type org.mmbase.bridge.jsp.taglib.pageflow.Url (rather then
  String).

- org.mmbase.storage.search.implementation.*. StringBuilders are used in API.

- org.mmbase.util was cleaned up a bit.
  e.g.
  org.mmbase.util.xml.ApplicationReader ->   org.mmbase.util.xml.applicationdata.ApplicationReader
  and similar changes


========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase versions need the following implementation versions of the servlet specification
(http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/) and Java. The shipped templates need implementations of the jsp specification
(http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/) and JSTL (http://java.sun.com/products/jsp/jstl/).

A complete J2EE implementation is not necessary.

Tomcat is an example servlet/jsp implementation, which many people use.


MMBase   Java   Servlet   JSP     JSTL   Tomcat  Orion
-----------------------------------------------------
1.8      1.4     2.3      1.2     1.1     4      2
1.9      5       2.4      2.0     1.1     5
2.0?     6       2.5      2.1     1.2     6


Furthermore MMBase needs a database and a jdbc-driver, or alternatively, a datasource resource
provided by the container.

The 'example webapp' includes an hsqldb database configuration and driver.


=========
Tested on:
=========

The applications listed here are known to be tested with MMBase, but
the list is probably a lot bigger :-)

Java versions

- J2SE 1.5

Java compilers
-------------

- Sun's javac 1.5

  When altering line 115 in org.mmbase.cache.CacheManager from
    Cache cache = getCache(cacheName);
  to
    Cache<?,?> cache = getCache(cacheName);
  the compiler will run into a bug in Sun's javac regarding the casting of
  generic types. See: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4916620
