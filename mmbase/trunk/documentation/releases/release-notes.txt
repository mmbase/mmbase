                     MMBase 1.8.0 - Release Notes
===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the changes that have been made in the final
release of MMBase 1.8.0, relative to the previous release of MMBase (1.7.x).

Bug reports should be entered at the bug reporting system for MMBase
at:

<http://www.mmbase.org/bug>


============
NEW FEATURES:
============

--------------------
General New Features:
--------------------
[1.8.0]
- Vwms (virtual web masters) have been removed from the core and placed in a
  separate 'vwms' application.

- SCAN is now a separate application. The application depends on the vwms
  application.

- Crontab is a new application that provides scheduling.

--------------------
Obsolete Features:
--------------------
[1.8.0]
- The 'ObjectTypes' class is merged into the 'TypeDef' class. Old code
  referencing ObjectTypes should reference TypeDef instead. This includes the
  typedef.xml builder configuration file.

- The storage configuration files were originally located in the mmbase.jar.
  In 1.8, these files have been moved to the storage/database directory in the mmbase config directory. Files that override the storage configuration need to be moved to the new directory.

- The 'Config' module and the 'AppTool' utility have been dropped from the
  code. Both tools provided visual input regarding configuration or
  application makeup, but were concidered outdated.
  References to these modules have been removed from the MMBase admin pages.

========================
Know Issues and Problems:
========================

- If your app-server supports JSP2.0 (e.g. tomcat5 with a 'new'
  web.xml or resin 3), then the new EL (Expression Language) syntax
  collides with the Expression language of mmbase taglib.

  MMBase Taglib JSP's using the ${} syntax might not work then. Often
  the {} can be avoided, otherwise the only option is to add <%@page
  isELIgnored="true" %> to the page.

  The generic JSP-editors in /mmbase/edit/basic could not be fixed to
  work with and without EL. When you want to use these editors in a EL
  environment isELIgnored must manually be added to
  /mmbase/edit/basic/page_base_functionality.jsp (Unfortunately it
  cannot always be present, because this setting can cause errors in a
  JSP1 environment).

  The EL and MMBase Taglib expressions languages are actually very
  similar to each other. We will try to make MMBase Taglib compatible
  (perhaps optionally so) with EL in a next release.

- The old database support classes are still in this release, but are
  not fully tested. These are deprecated please DO NOT use them
  anymore, but switch to the new database storage classes.

- Orion version < 2.x doesn't support the final servlet api 2.3,
  because of this the jumpersFilter will not work. You will need to
  remove the following lines from <WEB-INF/web.xml>:

    <!-- Filter for jumpers -->
    <filter>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <display-name>Jumpers Filter</display-name>
      <description>Filter used for jumpers</description>
      <filter-class>org.mmbase.servlet.JumpersFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>

    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>Jumpers Filter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

  And replace them with:

    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>servjumpers</servlet-name>
      <display-name>servjumpers</display-name>
      <servlet-class>org.mmbase.servlet.servjumpers</servlet-class>
    </servlet>

    <servlet-filter url-pattern="/*" servlet-name="servjumpers" />

  (I'm not sure where the last line has to be: web.xml or orion-web.xml).


- Length of email field inside Users and People builder isn't
  rfc-compliant, but with 255 it stays beyond a limit some databases
  use before switching to a bigger string-type (eg clob).

- Not all HTML is html4 or xhtml valid

- Sometimes it is needed to copy xml-apis.jar to
  <$CATALINA_HOME/common/lib/> or $ORION_HOME, eg if you're doing
  xslt-transformation or if you're using the editwizards.

- Imagemagick does work with Windows 98/ME, but MMBase is not able to
  use it. You have to use Jai (Java Advanced Imaging API). You can do
  this by changing the properties in

   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/builders/applications/images.xml (after installation of 'Resource')
   or
   <mmbase-webapp>/WEB-INF/config/applications/Resources/builders/images.xml (before installation of 'Resource')

   into:

  <properties>
    <property name="ImageConvertClass">
      org.mmbase.module.builders.ConvertJAI
    </property>
    <property name="MaxConcurrentRequests">20</property>
  </properties>

  Please keep in mind that the image builder is less powerful when
  using JAI instead of Imagemagick.

- Jumpers jump to /index.html by default, which can e.g. shield the
  image servlet (if 'dotlessly' mapped). Remove the setting from
  jumpers.xml if you prefer nice 404's (this is like this on default)

- Hsqldb uses the current dir for writing the database-files. This can
  be the bin dir from where you're starting the servlet-engine. You
  can change this to a dir you want, by changing the database-property
  in jdbc.xml.

- Resin provides its own XSL-transformation implementation, on this
  area are some known problems.

- Resin cannot swallow some of the larger jsp/taglib pages.


============
Requirements:
============

MMBase needs an servlet engine which supports the servlet api 2.3 and
jsp api 1.2. Furthermore it needs a database and a jdbc-driver.

The 'bin' distro does include a hsqldb database and driver.


=========
Tested on:
=========

The applications listed here are known to be tested with MMBase, but
the list is probably a lot bigger :-)

-------------
Java versions
-------------
- J2SE 1.4.2_02

- J2SE Blackdown-1.4.2

-------------
Java compilers
-------------

- sun jdk 1.4.2 (javac)

- sun jdk 1.5.0-beta (jikes does not work then)

- jikes version 1.18

  using 1.15 jsp-editwizards don't work (when using jikes for jsp-compilation)
  using 1.16 mmbase does compile, but give VerifyExceptions on running. See:
  http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=206&group_id=10
