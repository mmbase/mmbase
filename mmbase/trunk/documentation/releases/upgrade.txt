                     MMBase 1.8.0 - Upgrade Notes
===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the steps required to upgrade an existing
MMBase-installation. Please make sure you have a backup of all
important files (webapp, database) before upgrading.

- The classfile for the typedef builder has changed from
  org.mmbase.modules.corebuilder.ObjectTypes to org.mmbase.modules.corebuilder.TypeDef
  This needs to be changed in the typdef.xml configuration file.

- The storage configuration files were originally located in the mmbase.jar.
  To override them you had to place your version of the configuration file under classes/org/mmbase/storage/implementation/database/resources.
  In 1.8, these files have been moved to the storage/database directory in the mmbase config directory.
  If you override the storage configuration, you need to move your files to the new directory.

- If you use the multicast feature to cast changes between mmbase servers, and upgrade from a
  version < 1.7.2.
  The multicast configuration is moved from mmbaseroot.xml to utils/multicast.xml!
  Evaluate both these configuration files when you upgrade from a version < 1.7.2.

- Replace mmbase.jar with the new jars.
  - if you used editwizards, place mmbase-editwizard.jar (from
    mmbase-editwizard.zip)
  - if you used community, place mmbase-community.jar (from
    mmbase-community.zip). You can remove mmcommunity-taglib.tld too
    and place this in web.xml instead of:
    <taglib>
      <taglib-uri>http://www.mmbase.org/mmcommunity-taglib-1.0</taglib-uri>
      <taglib-location>/WEB-INF/lib/mmbase-community.jar</taglib-location>
    </taglib>

-  Replace and/or install all shipped jsps too.
   - generic editors are now shipped under /mmbase/edit/basic. You can
     follow this new convention and remove /mmeditors.  Or you
     copy/move the content to the original location /mmeditors/jsp

   - For admin pages goes the same. They are now in /mmbase/admin
     (used to be /mmadmin/jsp).

   - If you need the examples you could replace /mmexamples by the new
     content of /mmexamples

   - The editwizard jsp and xsls are shipped in /mmbase/edit/wizard
     (used to be /mmapps/editwizard). You can also download them
     seperately in mmbase-editwizard.zip now.

- remove WEB-INF/mmbase-taglib.tld and write in web.xml in stead:
  <taglib>
    <taglib-uri>http://www.mmbase.org/mmbase-taglib-1.0</taglib-uri>
    <taglib-location>/WEB-INF/lib/mmbase-taglib.jar</taglib-location>
  </taglib>
  Note that the taglib is not any more present in mmbase.jar
  itself. So if you wrote mmbase.jar here in web.xml you have to
  change it.

- copy and/or merge configuration files from WEB-INF/config.

- Clean the working directory of your app-server (to recompile jsp's)

- The fields parameter of the MMBase taglib list tags (related, list,
  etc) now no longer accepts fields that do not exist. Some pages may
  give errors now if they specified wrong fieldnames, so you are
  advised to check your site's pages for this error.

- If needed, convert the data directory where mmbase stored binary
  data.

- Check the releasenotes.txt for know issues and changes.
