    The Notifications application provides basic functionality to implement a notification
    mechanism using MMBase objects. That means that you can make any object 'notifyable' by
    linking a 'notifyables' object to it. Website visitors can then subscribe to those notifyables
    and receive notifications if something happens with the notifyable. In practice this is for
    example used to send Short Message Service text message a certain time before the commence of
    certain TV program.
