<!-- 
 jdbc.xml file, defines the variables needed to talk to the
 underlyig database. It combined with mmbaseroot.xml makes up
 the core of things you need to set to run mmbase on your machine/database.
 
 Good luck with MMbase.
 -->
<jdbc>

  <!-- 
	 <url> defines the jdbc url mmbase will use to connect to your database
	 it can use the following vars 
 
	 $HOST , set by <host>
	 $PORT , set by <port>
	 $DBM  , set by <database>

	 this way we can provide the url for several databases and you only need to
	 set the above variables.

	 While using JDBC 1.x use ';' instead of '&amp;' in the url tag !!!!!!
  -->
  <url>jdbc:mysql://$HOST:$PORT/$DBM?user=*****&amp;password=*****</url>

  <!--
	<driver>, defines the classname for the used jdbc driver this can be
	obtained from the documentation from the jdbc driver you use.
  -->	
  <driver>org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver</driver>

  <!--
	<database>, most database engines allow you to store multiple databases in one
	engine we need to select the database root we want to use within this engine. 
	make sure you are using a 'empty' database when you start using mmbase to make 
	sure you don't create problems for other users of the database engine you are 
	using.
  -->
  <database>install</database>

  <!--
	<user>, what is the user we will use to login to the database, if set to 'url' it 
	will use one defined with the 'url' command above this is needed for several 
	databases including mysql.
  -->
  <user>url</user>


  <!--
	<password>, what is the password we will use to login to the database, if set 
	to 'url' it will use one defined with the 'url' command above this is needed 
	for several databases including mysql.
  -->
  <password>url</password>


  <!--
	<host>, what host will we connect to (that is running the database) 
	when you run mmbase on the same machine as this mmbase node it can 
	be set to 'localhost'
  -->
  <host>localhost</host>

  <!--
	<port> what port is this database engine running on ? you can find the is 
	your database manual or ask the database admin. default ports for 
	supported databases are :

	 3306 for mysql.
  -->
  <port>3306</port>

  <!--
	<connections>,  mmbase does its own database connection pooling 
	(keeping connections to the database open over several database 
	query's, to speed up query's by not logging in and closing
	the connection on every qeury). 'connections' allows you to set 
	the number of connections mmbase keeps open to the database.
  -->
  <connections>20</connections>

  <!--
	<querys>, mmbase will replace these connections every x query's 
	because alot of the databases drivers, jdbc drivers etc etc have 
	memory leaks or other possible problems. with 'querys' you can set 
	the number that will be done per connection before it gets replaced 
	with a new connection.
  -->
  <querys>256</querys>

  <!--
	<supportclass>, the jdbc module will use this class to do database 
	specific things to a connection (ie for informix it sets the lockmode)
  -->
  <supportclass>org.mmbase.module.database.DatabaseSupportShim</supportclass>
