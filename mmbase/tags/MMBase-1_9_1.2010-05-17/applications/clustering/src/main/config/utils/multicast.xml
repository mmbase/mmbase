      What is Multicast?

      Multicast is essentially the ability to send one IP packet to multiple receivers. Multicast is often used
      for audio and video conferencing systems. You often hear about the Mbone in reference to Multicast. The Mbone
      is essentially a ``virtual backbone'' which exists in the Internet itself. If you want to send and/or receive
      Multicast, you need to be ``on the Mbone.''

      Things to remember:
      1 Multicast tunnels/configurations/infrastructure are often unstable. You may lose multicast connectivity
      but still have unicast connectivity.
      2 Multicast does not reduce the number of ICP replies being sent around. It does reduce the number of ICP
      queries sent, but not the number of replies.

    <!--
	name="multicastTTL" The Multicast TTL determines how ``far'' your ICP queries will go.
	In the Mbone, there is a certain TTL threshold defined for each network interface or tunnel.
	A multicast packet's TTL must be larger than the defined TTL for that packet to be forwarded
	across that link. For example, the mrouted manual page recommends:
	32   for links that separate sites within an organization.
	64   for links that separate communities or organizations, and are
        attached to the Internet MBONE.
	128  for links that separate continents on the MBONE.
	A good way to determine the TTL you need is to run mtrace and look at the last line. It will
	show you the minimum TTL required to reach the other host. Mtrace can be downloaded from
	Xerox PARC FTP site (ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/net-research/ipmulti/)
	If you set you TTL too high, then your ICP messages may travel ``too far'' and will be subject
	to eavesdropping by others. If you're only using multicast on your LAN, as we suggest, then your
	TTL will be quite small, for example ttl=4.
