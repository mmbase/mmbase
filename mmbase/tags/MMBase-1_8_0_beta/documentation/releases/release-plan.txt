===================================================================

TODO for 1.8.0 release of MMBase:

I Core/Project abstraction

The following applications should be removed from the core and moved to a separate application:

- SCAN, including the org.mmbase.module.gui.html.* classes and supporting util classes (i.e. scanpage)
  This includes removing SCAN specific hooks from some core classes (an alternative is needed to
  provide backward compatibility).
  DONE

- Email application: find a solution for the email module class interface that is now in the core
  DONE?

- Config module and org.mmbase.config: xml parsers and color coders (perhaps a rewrite is better?)
  DROPPED

- Tools: move utility classes, modules, and builders that are still useful to a tools application
  (or in case this is too hard, tag them for inclusion in a later release)
  SKIP

- Future non-core projects should also be deployed in separate applications packages.
   DONE?

- If possible applicatuons should be configured to work with the Packaging project (if this project
  proves stable).
  DO

II - Cleaning

The following steps should be made to clean the code. Note that part of this is also done during abstraction

- removing all old database support and storage classes
  DONE
  
- remove all utility classes, modules, and builders that are no longer used, i.e. DateSupport or
  Storable
  DONE
  
- Mark xerces/xalan dependent code for future change (there is no solution for this dependency yet)
  DONE

- cleaning of the html-dir
  DO

III Improvements

The following Core functionality will be evalued and (if needed and possible) improved in 1.8.  It is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for this one.

- Multicast: select an appropriate (or pluggable) communication system, solve issues with bursts of
  change events
  DO

- Modules and Builders: implement a proper way for loading, unloading, reloading, and shutting down
  modules and builders
  SKIP

- Security: field-level security checks
  SKIP

IV Performance and Maintenance

Performance issues should be analyzed and if possible resolved. It is possible that actual changes are delayed to a later release if it proves too time consuming for this one.
Performance and maintenance related issues are:

- Monitoring of MMBase performance issues, i.e. profiling
  SKIP

- Running on packaged war (xml configuration as resources)
  DONE

- serving images staticly
  SKIP

- related-nodes optimalisation (passing queries to parent)
  SKIP

- create a better build-process
  SKIP

V Projects

The following projects should be finished or brought in a stable state.
This is dependent on input from the project manager.
New projects that are not in a stable state will not be deployed in the 1.8 release.

- Cleaning Project, fase II (see above)
  PENDING
- Distro project
  PENDING
- Field types project
  DO
  ----> DO FIX RMMCI 
  ----> DO Review code and new methods (org.mmbase.bridge.*, org.mmbase.datatypes.*)

- Richtext project
  DO
- Taglib II project
  DONE
- Packaging project (new, formerly 'Applications II')
  SKIP
- Cache release stategies
  DO, or decide to HOLD

- Editwizard 2
   Planned for 1.8.1


VI Other

- update and improve documentation
  DO

- testing
   - junit tests must succeed
     DO
   - junit tests must be reviewed
     DO
   - other test areas 
      (new features in 1.8)
      - Taglib & EL
      - DataTypes
      - Events and Clustering
      - Imaging
      - Security
         -test generality of e.g. basic editors. The idea is that they work with every security
           implementation, but this is not yet finished IIRC.
