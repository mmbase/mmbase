Filemanager.

    The filemanager is implemented by the 
    src/education/templates/education/filemanagement/index.jsp file. It allows 
    contenteditors to upload files to the filesystem. For each uploaded file it 
    also creates an urls, audiotapes or videotapes link in the mmbase system.

    There are two init-parameters in the web.xml with which you can configure 
    the filemanager:

        filemanagementBaseDirectory
            the directory where the uploaded files should be stored

        filemanagementBaseUrl
            the url pointing to that directory


    Notes: the filemanager uses the apache commons fileupload library, which
    doesn't cooperate well with the mmbase taglib, therefore, all operations
    that work with the upload request *must* take place before the use of
    <mm:cloud> and <mm:import>.
