      This package is a container for all MMBase applications. 
    </p>
     <p>
      An 'application' is a set of classes or resource files that add a certain (defined) functionality to MMBase.
      Applications are not part of the core code, and are not crucial for the running of MMBase (though applications may depend on each other).
