This is the support class for changing userid and group on platforms
that require this.

The native code should be portable to most unix systems.

If your platform doesn't need this (because of no restrictions on
binding to ports below 1024) see if it is checked for in SetUser.java

Currently supported in the Makefile are :
Solaris
Linux

Testing on your platform can easily be done by using the provided Main.java

Also set your shared library path to this directory before starting
youre server if you use the code, by setting -Dmmbase.userlevel=<user>:<group> 
Most likely : LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<ServerRoot>/mmbase/util/platform
