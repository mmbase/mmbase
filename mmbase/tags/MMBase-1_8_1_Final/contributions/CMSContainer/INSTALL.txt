Follow the following steps:

Step 0:

Install the following versions of the software:
- Java 1.5 (of 1.4)
- Maven 1.0.2  (use this version or it will NOT work!!!)
- Tomcat 5.5
- Mysql 4.1
Include by this project are:
- MMbase HEAD
- Pluto 1.0.1


Step 1:
Set the following environment settings:
(using your install paths)
# java settings
  JAVA_HOME=c:\java\1.5.0_03
  JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx256M -Dfile.encoding=utf-8
# Remote debgging
  JPDA_ADDRESS=8000
  JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket
# maven settings
  MAVEN_HOME=C:\java\maven-1.0.2
  MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL=c:\projects\.maven
  Path=%PATH%;C:\java\maven-1.0.2\bin
# tomcat settings
  TOMCAT_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5.9
  CATALINA_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5.9

Step 2:
Make maven work:
First upgrade your maven ear plugin from version 1.6 to 1.6.1 with the following 
command:
maven plugin:download -DgroupId=maven -DartifactId=maven-ear-plugin -Dversion=1.6.1

The cmsc maven build will only succeed when the artifacts of the mmbase head are
present in the local maven repository, There is not yet a remote repository 
with up-to-date artifacts available on mmbase.org

The mmbase head artifacts can be installed by checking out the ALL module from 
cvs.mmbase,org. After the checkout run "maven all:install" in the root.
More information is in the MMBASE.txt and MAVEN.txt files
 

Step 3:
Configure the database:
- The cmsc uses a J2ee datasource for the database connection of mmbase. 
  The <TOMCAT_HOME>/common/lib should contain the following jars.
  * commons-collections-3.1.jar
  * commons-dbcp-1.2.1.jar
  * commons-pool-1.2.jar
  * hsqldb-1.7.3.0.jar
  * mysql-connector-java-3.1.10-bin.jar

- The server/tomcat directory contains a xml file which should be moved to
  <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/Catalina/localhost.
  Alter the settings in this file to match your local database

- Create and run the sql script to your database.
  This script is cmsc.sql in the root of this project
  NOTE: the cmsc.sql is an db with example data and is not always up 
  to date with the sources. When you experience problems when browsing
  the cmsc web application then start with an empty database.
 
Step 4:
- Run the first-time-cmsc.bat (or .sh) in scripts directory.
  NOTE: following runs should use cmsc.bat to clean previous build files.
- And start your tomcat.

  Front-end: http://localhost:8080/cmsc-webapp/TestSite/




Tips:
- set the environment setting "BUILD_OPTS" to "-o" to increase the build time a lot
  using this setting, maven will not try to download stuff from remote repositories,
  so make sure everything is already local!
