                     MMBase 1.9.0 - Upgrade Notes
===================================================================

============
INTRODUCTION:
============

This document describes the steps required to upgrade an existing (1.8)
MMBase-installation. Please make sure you have a backup of all
important files (webapp, database) before upgrading.

- MMBase 1.9.0 requires java 1.5 to build. We recommend using a 1.5 JVM too.
  (I'm not sure whether that is absolutely necessary)

- Replace all mmbase.jar's with new jars.

-  Replace and/or install all shipped jsps too.
   - Important is the /mmbase directory for generic editors and admin-pages.

   - If you need the examples you could replace /mmexamples by the new
     content of /mmexamples

   - The editwizard jsp and xsls are shipped in /mmbase/edit/wizard
     (used to be /mmapps/editwizard). You can also download them
     seperately in mmbase-editwizard.zip now.
- copy and/or merge configuration files from WEB-INF/config.

- Clean the working directory of your app-server (to recompile jsp's)

- Check the releasenotes.txt for know issues and changes.
