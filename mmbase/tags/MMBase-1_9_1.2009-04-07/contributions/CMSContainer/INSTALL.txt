Follow the following steps:

Step 0:

Install the following versions of the software:
- Java 1.5
- Maven 1.1  (use a maven 1 version. Maven 2 is not supported yet.
- Tomcat 5.5
- Mysql 4.1


Step 1:
Set the following environment settings:
(use your install paths)
# java settings
  JAVA_HOME=c:\java\1.5
  JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx256M -Dfile.encoding=utf-8
# Remote debgging
  JPDA_ADDRESS=8000
  JPDA_TRANSPORT=dt_socket
# maven settings
  MAVEN_HOME=C:\java\maven-1.1
  MAVEN_HOME_LOCAL=c:\projects\.maven
  Path=%PATH%;C:\java\maven-1.1\bin
# tomcat settings
  TOMCAT_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5
  CATALINA_HOME=C:\servers\tomcat-5.5

Step 2:
Configure tomcat and the database:
- The cmsc uses a J2ee datasource for the database connection of mmbase.
  The <TOMCAT_HOME>/common/lib should contain the following jars.
  * mysql-connector-java-5.0.x-bin.jar

- The server/tomcat directory contains a xml file which should be moved to
  <TOMCAT_HOME>/conf/Catalina/localhost.
  Alter the settings in this file to match your local database

- Create an empty database
 
Step 3:
- Run the first-time-cmsc.bat (or .sh) in scripts directory.
  NOTE: following runs should use cmsc.bat to clean previous build files.
- And start your tomcat.
  Editors: http://localhost:8080/cmsc-webapp/editors/
  Front-end: http://localhost:8080/cmsc-webapp/TestSite/


Tips:
- set the environment setting "BUILD_OPTS" to "-o" to increase the build time a lot
  using this setting, maven will not try to download stuff from remote repositories,
  so make sure everything is already local!
