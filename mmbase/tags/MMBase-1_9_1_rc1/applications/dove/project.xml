  <shortDescription>MMBase Dove XML interface application</shortDescription>
  <description>
    The MMBase Dove application provides an XML interface to MMBase. This interface used to be part of the
    Editwizards software, but nowadays it is a seperate component.
    When using Dove, you must implement the XML api yourself. It was created before standards as XML-RPC and SOAP were
    available. If you need to access the full MMBase Bridge API remotely, you are encouraged to use RMMCI instead.
