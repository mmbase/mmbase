(See the MAVEN.txt when you have maven related issues)

prerequisitions
---------------

- java >= 1.4 
- maven 1.0.2

To install maven, expand it into a directory and set the environment and
path variable to this directory:

@> cd tmp
@> tar zxvf ~/maven-1.0-rc1.tar.gz
@> MAVEN_HOME=$HOME/tmp/maven-1.0-rc1
@> export MAVEN_HOME
@> PATH=$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin

Maven documentation
-------------------

A nice small overview of what maven is, how to configure it and how to
use it, can be downloaded from the following location:

 http://www.sandcastsoftware.com/downloads/maven/ProJavaToolsChap26_Maven.pdf

import external libraries
-------------------------

Due to license restrictions some libraries can't be redistribitued by others
than Sun, so you'll have to get it yourself. You'll have to download each one 
and place it in your local Maven repository (on UNIX systems, this defaults 
to ~/.maven/repository/; on Windows, it's in the equivalent "home" directory)

The jai-core and jai-codec can be downloaded from the following website:

 - http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/index.jsp

If you already have a mmbase-checkout, those jai-file can be readily copied 
from that installation into the maven-repository.

@> cp ${mmbasepath}/build/lib/jai_codec.jar ~/.maven/repository/jai/jars/jai_codec-1.1.2_01.jar   
@> cp ${mmbasepath}/build/lib/jai_core.jar ~/.maven/repository/jai/jars/jai_core-1.1.2_01.jar 

Working with maven
------------------

After you have made changes to the code, you may want to compile it. This can be accomplished 
by typing 'maven all:install' everytime. But with maven, you can speed this up a little bit. 

Type 'maven console'. This will give a command-line menu of your targets. Type 'all:install'
to compile and install the code. After this, simply use 'enter' to recompile the code.
Use 'quit' to exit and go back.
