  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>What exactly is MMBase? How is its software organized, and how will it grow overtime? The number of organizations involved with MMBase is increasing. This presents new opportunities to share and collaborate, provided that these questions are anwered.

In this document, the MMBase Management Commitee (MMC) presents guidelines for the MMBase community.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>MMBase community</title>
    <para>An increasing number of people and organizations is involved with MMBase, one way or another. Together they comprise the MMBase community, an ecosystem surrounding MMBase and fostering new developments.

In order to ensure a healthy community, it is vital that the roles and responsibilities of its citizens are clearly established. The following groups can be distinguished.</para>

    <section>
      <title>MMC (MMBase Management Commitee)</title>
      <para>The MMC coordinates the Open Source process, the development and releases of MMBase distributions. Its mission is to maintain a stable platform for MMBase developers, and ensure a good evolution of the MMBase software.
To achieve its goals it relies on good communication among the developers community.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>MMBase developers</title>
      <para>These are the developers that develop and maintain the MMBase distributions.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>External developers</title>
      <para>These are developers that develop software that extends the basic functionality of MMBase. This may be complete (web) applications or reusable components.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Users</title>
      <para>Finally, these are the users of the resulting software. Often they are also the owners of the finished applications and components, as that result from projects commissioned by them.  </para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>MMBase parts</title>
    <para>In order to enable the community to contribute to the various software components, a distinction is made between different categories of components. These are the following categories.</para>

    <section>
      <title>MMBase core</title>
      <para>The MMBase core is the base of all MMBase software. It includes Storage and the Security interfaces, as well as the MMBase Cloud Interface (MMCI=Bridge), which provides a stable and backwards compatible interface to the MMBase core.

See Figure 1: MMBase Architectural Overview.

Reusable software components that extend the functionality of the core are called packages. 
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>MMBase community packages</title>
      <para>MMBase community packages are packages that are maintained by the MMBase developers for one of several reasons: [R2] 
        <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          Its use is (expected to be) widespread;
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          As an example;
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          For backwards compatibility with previous releases.
        </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        The MMC and the committers can vote about what should be MMBase packages.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>MMBase external packages</title>
      <para>MMBase external packages are all packages which are not MMBase community packages. These are typically developed by external developers, and fall outside the responsibility of the MMBase Developers.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Community process</title>
    <para>The community provides opportunities for organizations to contribute and collaborate. The driving force behind this proces is the fact that several organizations may have similar needs. Accordingly, the costs of developing pieces of functionality can be shared.

At present these opportunities are not exploited to its full potential. The obstacles here can be of a various nature.

The MMC aims to facilitate such collaboration. In order to do so, the MMC strives to address the technical and infrastructural obstacles.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Technical</title>
      <para>At present there is no easy standard way to package, distribute or install a package. This will be adressed by the “packages” project, which in the future will provide standard tools for the process.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Infrastructure</title>
      <para>The MMC maintains a list of external packages on the MMBase website (http://www.mmbase.org/packages). This list will include all contributed packages that that are brought to the attention of MMC, when they satisfy these requirements.</para>

      <para>Minimal requirements:
        <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          available for download
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          actively maintained
        </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
Note that the minimal requirements do not require the software to be Open Source. A community mailing list is available which can be used to discuss topics related to the development of external packages. The community mailing list can be found at http://www.mmbase.org/contact. The MMC and the MMBase foundation can also be addressed with questions related to the development of external packages. The foundation can help in gathering needs of users, the MMC can provide information more technical related information. e.g. Which parts should you develop as an external package and which parts should be integrated with the core. </para> 
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Open Source</title>
      <para>When is software Open Source? There are different definitions in use. Within the MMBase community the MMC recommends the use of the following criteria.</para>

      <para>Recommendations:
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        sourcecode available for download
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        documentation included
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        license compatible with Mozilla Public License
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        contact-details of people available for support
      </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>How to contribute</title>
      <para>Always a good start for developing MMBase software, is to review ideas within the MMBase community. Check which parts of the new software should become an external package, and which parts should become part of the MMBase core, or MMBase packages.

Notify the MMBase community with your developments. In this way it can be avoided that the same functionality is being made twice by different community members, and possible collaboration can be achieved.

Ask the MMC to put information about your package online when the package is available.

For the community it’s crucial to be able to rely on packages that are being made available. So please don’t offer the community packages hoping that they will maintain them, but maintain the package yourself. If you think the package is of great importance and should be maintained by the MMBase developers you can ask the MMBase developers to make it a MMBase packages. The MMC and the committers will vote about the package to become an MMBase package, or to stay an external package.</para>
