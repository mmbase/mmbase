    <p>
	  This package contains several bridge related classes which can be used independently of the
	  rest of MMBase.
    </p>
    <p>
	  This package contains also some implementation of bridge interfaces. In contradiction to
	  implemenations in org.mmbase.bridge.implementation, these classes do <em>not</em> depend on
	  MMBase core classes, and have public constructors.
