In this directory, you can place 'applications' (AKA 'apps1')

In this context an application is a set with:

 - A piece of a cloud model (allowed relations, roles, builders)
    This is described in an XML in this directory.

    If a builder is not available in config/builders then it can be provided in this directory
    (normally  in <application name>/builders/<builder xml>).	
    On deployl of the application, these builder xml's are then _copied_ to
    config/builders/applications
    (So this last directory must be writable by the application server if you want this to work.

 - Content belonging this this application.  
   This is referred by the application XML, and is commonly in a subdirectory with the name of the application.


This is normally used to fill a new site with initial data. The inverse process (exporting an
existing site) is also possible (See http://localhost/mmbase/admin -> applications). But this is not
optimized for large sites. For moving sites you can simply use the dump features of the database
itself.
