To install MMBase richtext:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- You may want to download the latest version (compiled against 1.8.4, java 1.5) from:
  http://www.mmbase.org/download/richtext/


- You need a servlet 2.4 compatible application server like Tomcat 5. Your web.xml must be at least
   version 2.4 (to enable EL).

	 index.jspx must be a 'welcome-file'
	 something like this in web.xml:
  <welcome-file-list>
    <welcome-file>index.jspx</welcome-file>
    <welcome-file>index.jsp</welcome-file>
    <welcome-file>default.jsp</welcome-file>
    <welcome-file>index.html</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>


- You need MMBase 1.8, complete with the shipped jstl.jar and standard.jar

then:

- Place from web-app/WEB-INF/lib  mmbase-richtext.jar, kupu-i18n.jar and mmbase-kupu-i18n.jar in
   your <your web-app>/WEB-INF/lib.

- Copy everything from the directory web-app/mmbase to <your web-app>/mmbase. It contains a
   directory 'kupu' and one css in mmbase/style/css.

- (Re)start MMBase.

To install the demo:

- Copy the directory web-app/templates, e.g. to <your web-app>/richtext

- Use your browser to see the index.jspx of this directory and read it.



To compile MMBase richtext from sources.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The richtext of MMBase HEAD is developed a bit further, and does compmile agains MMBase 1.8. So you
may want to do this because of that.

Do place config/xslt/2xhtml-mmbase18.xslt in WEB-INF/config/xslt/2xhtml.xslt though.
The MMBase 1.8 DOM generator cannot generate id-attribute (not supported in java 1.4), but the id()
function _is_ used in the default 2xhtml.xslt to speed up performance. (You can also use the
Generator.class in WEB-INF/classes/org/mmbase/bridge/util/xml if you run java 1.5).

To build the complete rich text package, you also need to check out kupu and build it. This happens
automaticly by the ant script in this directory.

But it needs the following command-line tools
- svn (to check out kupu)
- make (to build kupu)
- tools from gettext (to compile the i18n jars from kupu)
- xsltprc  (libxml2, libxslt, used to compose the kupu-page from .kupu source). I tried to use xalan
   here, but no luck. Used to build /mmbase/kupu/mmbase/index.jspx from *.kupu files.

The target is 'package' to create a fresh mmbase-richtext.zip.
