        name="unicastport" on what port does this multicast talking between nodes
        take place, This can be set to any port but check if something else on
        your network is allready using multicast when you have problems.
    -->

    <!--
        If you want to use the same config file for differnt servers on the same host, then you can
        also set the port by prefixing it with the machine name.  This syntax can also be used, if
        different ports for different servers must be used, because these settings are used for both
        receiving and sending. 
        E.g. like this:
    -->
    <property name="michiel.omroep.nl/mm18/.unicastport">16080</property>
    <property name="michiel.omroep.nl/mm182/.unicastport">16081</property>

    <!--
        name="unicasttimeout"  the time another MMbase server has to respond.
    -->
    <property name="unicasttimeout">10000</property>
