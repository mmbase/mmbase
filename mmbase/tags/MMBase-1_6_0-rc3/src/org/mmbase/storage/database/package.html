      The storage implementation for various types of databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      These classes implement functionality for accessing specific database systems through JDBC,
      making use of each database's characteristics, such as inheritance, specific SQL syntax requirements,
      generation of keys or indexes, and optimalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access the Storage interface. Note that for backwards compatibility reasons it is also possible to use the MMJDBC2NodeInterface.
