Intro:
This is a small remark about using the nedstat tag in a customerspecific environment. 

When using the nedstat tag, please add an environment variable in the context file in the live environment to indicate whether or not this is the
production environment. The nedstat tags are only added when in the live environment and when there is an environment variable called 'server/production'
that is set to 'true':

<Environment name="server/production" value="true" type="java.lang.String" />
