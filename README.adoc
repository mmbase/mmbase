= MMBase 1.9

The last stable version of MMBase was 1.9

SNAPSHOTS are now build with github actions and published to sonatype. It uses https://github.com/mmbase/docker[this docker image] to provide the necessary environment for that.

I'll try to make minor release soon, so all artifacts have a version  on maven central.

To build locally you could try out https://github.com/nektos/act[act] to avoid having to arrange everything yourself. Just install docker and act.
