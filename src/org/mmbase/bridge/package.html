      The main interface to MMBase, also known as `MMCI' (MMBase Cloud Interface). One of the core
      interfaces of this package is indeed `Cloud', which gives direct access to MMBase data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Script languages can access MMBase in this way. JSP can e.g. do this rather directly, or a
      little less directly by use of the MMBase Taglib.
