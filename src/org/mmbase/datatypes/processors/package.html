      Plugins into set- and getValue methods on Node (Setting and getting Fields).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this directory the framework for putting functionality there is implemented. The basic
      agent is 'ValueIntercepter' which reads an XML and provides the set- and get-Value
      implemntation with the specified 'Processor'.
    </p>
    <p>
      When functionality is added to a certain field type then a Processor must be implemented and turned on in
      datatypes.xml or the builder xml.
