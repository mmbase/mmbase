    <p>
      The MMBase standard and optional builders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes in this package are extensions of MMObjectBuilder, or support classes
      for these builders (such as probes and exceptions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each class implements some additonal Functionality.
      A number of these builders work together to form an application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default (featureless) builder used by MMBase is Dummy.
      Note that a number of essential buidlers (core buidlers) are located in a separate package.
