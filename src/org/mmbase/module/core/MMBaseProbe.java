/**
 * MMBaseProbe is a thread-like object that gets instantiated by MMbase.
 * It calls the callback method {@link MMBase#doProbeRun} in MMbase, which in turn probes the builders.
 * After the probe has been preformed, it schedules itself to be destroyed after an alotted time (10 minutes),
 * which also clears the reference in MMBase and prompts that module to create a new probe instance.
 * This way, maintanance is scheduled to run every ten minutes.
