    <p>
      The database support classes for accessing various types of databases.
    </p>
    <p>
      These classes implement functionality for accessing specific database systems through JDBC,
      making use of each database's characteristics, such a sinheritance, specific SQL syntax requirements,
      generation of keys or indexes, and optimalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Access these classes either through the MMJDBC2NodeInterface or (for newer classes)
      the Storage interface. Note that the latter will in time replace the former.
    </p>

    @deprecated This code is scheduled for removal once MMBase has been fully converted to the new StorageManager implementation.
