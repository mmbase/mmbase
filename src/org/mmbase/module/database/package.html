    <p>
      The classes and interfaces that arrange the actual connection to JDBC database.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contains the JDBC module, which implements the JDBCInterface and is the main entrypoint when
      retrieving a connnection to a selected database layer (defined in the support package).
    </p>
    <p>
        It also contains code for the implementation of a connection pool, for use with JDBC2.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally it contains classes that define the Transaction and Storage interfaces, and exceptions
        that may be thrown by the support classes. Note that these classes may eventually be moved
        to a more generic package (i.e. org.mmbase.storage)
