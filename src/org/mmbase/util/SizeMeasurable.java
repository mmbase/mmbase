/**
 * The SizeOf class tries to determine the size of memory structures.
 * This is tried by reflection and so on, but if an object is
 * 'SizeMeasurable' then it is asked to the object directly.
 *
 * So, if your object stores its bulk in private members, and you want
 * its size to be determined adequately, then you should let it
 * implement this interface.
 *
 * If you did not implement a class yourself, but have a clue how to
 * guess the size anyhow, then you could also put this implementation
 * in SizeOf itself (as for example was done for String). The
 * disadvantage of this approach is of course that you don't have
 * access to private members.
