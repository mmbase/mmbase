      MMBase is based on servlets. To start MMBase you have to have at least one servlet which
      extends MMBaseServlet. It could be MMBaseServlet itself (which can't do much by itself, but
      MMBase then is availabe in your jsp).

    <p>
      A very normal servlet to have it a an image servlet. There are two now: ImageServlet and
      'servdb'. The latter used to be the 'all purpose' MMBase servlet, but as soon as all purposes
      are migrated to stand alone, more clean, servlets this class will be deprecated.
