      MMBase is based on servlets. To start MMBase you have to have at least one servlet which
      extends MMBaseServlet. It could be MMBaseServlet itself (which can't do much by itself - it
      will give back the version only - but MMBase then is availabe in your JSP-pages).
    </p>
    <p>
      The abstract 'BridgeServlet' can be used to base new servlets upon in which the MMBase 'cloud'
      is to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very normal servlet to have it a an image servlet. There are two now: ImageServlet and
      'servdb'. The latter used to be the 'all purpose' MMBase servlet, but as soon as all purposes
      are migrated to stand alone, more clean, servlets this class will be deprecated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are also a few servlet presents in the package which are mere `test' or `demo' servlets.
