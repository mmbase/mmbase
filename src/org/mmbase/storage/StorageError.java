 * This error gets thrown when something goes seriously - and likely unrecoverably - wrong in the storage layer.
 * This includes database connection failures at startup, non-existing vital resources, etc.
 * In general, a StorageError should indicate that a storage layer is unuseable. 
 * This will normally mean MMBase will fail to start.
