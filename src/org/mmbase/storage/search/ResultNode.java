/**
 * A <code>ResultNode</code> is a virtual node, used to represent
 * the result of executing an arbitrary search query.
 * <p>
 * The fields of this node correspond to the fields of the
 * result of the query. Consequently, and unlike real a real node, a
 * <code>ResultNode</code> does not necessarilly have number,
 * owner or otype fields.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the fields of this node can have arbitrary names,
 * specified by the field aliases in the search query.
 * <p>
 * The parent builder of a <code>ResultNode</code> is always a
 * {@link ResultBuilder ResultBuilder}, that contains info on the node's fields.
